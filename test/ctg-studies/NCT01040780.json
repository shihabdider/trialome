It is the leading cause of death of cancer in man and 2nd in women. With the development of gefitinib and erlotinib, EGFR-TKI (epidermal growth factor receptor -tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is the most successful novel drugs developed for the treatment of these patients in recent years, especially for NSCLC patients in Asia including China. Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of Chinese scientists and clinician. It appears to be at least as good as gefitinib in terms of efficacy and better in terms of safety in phase I/II trials. In this study, a randomized, double-blind, gefitinib as control, multi-center phase III trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotinib in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients after failure of 1 or 2 chemotherapy. PFS (progress free survival) is the primary end-point with OS (overall survival), ORR (objective response), TTP (time to progress), HRQOL and safety as the secondary end-point. A total of 400 patients will be recruited. EGFR and K-ras gene mutational analysis as well as a population PK study have also been proposed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Efficacy","Safety","EGFR-TKI","phase III","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":399,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Icotinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"125 mg three times daily (375 mg per day) by mouth","interventionNames":["Drug: Icotinib"]},{"label":"Gefitinib","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"250 mg every 24 hours by mouth","interventionNames":["Drug: Gefitinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Icotinib","description":"125 mg three times daily (375 mg per day) by mouth","armGroupLabels":["Icotinib"],"otherNames":["BPI-2009","Conmana"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Gefitinib","description":"250 mg every 24 hours by mouth","armGroupLabels":["Gefitinib"],"otherNames":["ZD1839","Iressa"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression Free Survival","description":"Progression is defined, using RECIST, as a measurable increase in the smallest dimension of any target or non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, since baseline.","timeFrame":"2-7 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"Median number of months from first study treatment until time of death","timeFrame":"From first study treatment until time of death"},{"measure":"Best Tumor Response","description":"Change in size of tumor: Complete Response (CR) = no measurable tumor; Partial Response (PR) = 30% decrease in size of measurable tumor; Stable Disease (SD) = measurable tumor size has not changed; Progressive Disease (PD) = measurable tumor larger than at baseline","timeFrame":"While receiving study treatment; assessed every 21 days until progression"},{"measure":"Time To Progression","description":"Median time until disease progression.
