Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ramucirumab, a drug which has anti-angiogenic and pleotropic immunomodulatory effects and may synergize with the effect of an anti-PD-1 agent. The study investigates the effect of targeted anti-antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and immune-suppressive activity of VEGF-inhibitor ramicirumab to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerability of the combination.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate response rate of the combination of ramucirumab and pembrolizumab in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate safety, tolerability, and survival for patients receiving pembrolizumab and ramucirumab.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To characterize predictive immunologic biomarkers of response in tissue and peripheral blood of patients receiving ramucirumab and pembrolizumab combination therapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ramucirumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
