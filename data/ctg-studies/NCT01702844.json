Patients will be required to have progressed on a single prior regimen. Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 will be administered intravenously, weekly for 3 weeks of every 4-week cycle. After every two cycles of therapy, imaging will be performed to assess for response. Patients will be eligible to continue receiving therapy until the time of disease progression.\n\nPrimary Objectives To evaluate the tolerability of weekly nab-paclitaxel in older adults with advanced lung cancer who have progressed on at least 1 prior regimen after 6 cycles or 3 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, for those who come off treatment earlier.\n\nSecondary Objectives To estimate overall survival To estimate progression-free survival To estimate the response rate\n\nCorrelative Objectives To explore baseline components of the Geriatric Assessment (GA) as predictors of chemotherapy tolerance and overall survival To explore the use of p16 measurements in the elderly as predictors of chemotherapy tolerance and overall survival To explore the impact of weekly nab-paclitaxel treatment on quality of life, as measured by Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"],"keywords":["Nab paclitaxel","Abraxane","First Line","Non small cell lung cancer","NSCLC","Phase II","Non-Randomized","Elderly","Lineberger","UNC","LCCC 1210"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"nab paclitaxel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive nab-paclitaxel once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 week cycle","interventionNames":["Drug: Nab-Paclitaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nab-Paclitaxel","description":"Administer 2 cycles of Nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1 8 and 15","armGroupLabels":["nab paclitaxel"],"otherNames":["Abraxane"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Subjects Without Any Adverse Events Grade 3 or Higher","description":"Tolerability of weekly nab-paclitaxel, as measured by occurrence of Grade 3 or worse toxicity after 6 cycles or 3 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, for those who came off treatment earlier as measured by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE, version 4.
