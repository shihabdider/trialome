The patient will be asked to take the study drug by mouth on days 1-28 of each study cycle. As part of this study, the patient will have blood samples other tests, exams and procedures done for study purposes and their standard of care. Patient participation in the study will last for up to 2 years after completion of the last dose of the study drug or until your condition worsens or intolerable adverse events as deemed by the study doctor.\n\nThere are possible patient risks to this study that include but are not limited to diarrhea, changes to the lining of the mouth (e.g. ulcers), rash, dry skin, itching, and nail infections."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["EGFR Mutation","osimertinib","exon 18 G719X","exon 20 S7681","exon 21 L861Q"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"osimertinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: osimertinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"osimertinib","description":"80 mg oral administration daily","armGroupLabels":["osimertinib"],"otherNames":["Tagrisso"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective Response Rate as Assessed by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)","description":"The number of participants who have a partial response or complete response to the study drug.

NOTE: If there is a history of prior malignancy, patients must not be receiving other specific treatment (i.e. hormonal therapy) for their cancer\n* Prior radiotherapy ≤ 14 days\n* Untreated symptomatic brain metastases (treated brain metastases are allowed provided \\> 14 days have elapsed from completion of radiotherapy and patient is neurologically stable as assessed by treating physician).\n* Malabsorption syndrome, refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of osimertinib\n* Detection of concurrent EGFR mutation with exon 20 T790M, exon 19 deletion, exon 21 L858R mutation or exon 20 insertion. Patients with compound (also referred to as multiple mutations) will be excluded if the molecular testing includes one of these mutations.\n* Active pregnancy or breast-feeding: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of osimertinib on the development of the fetus are unknown, and there is potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with osimertinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents.\n* Grade ≥ 2 blurred vision, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, dry eye, or keratitis","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
