Monthly bolus 5-FU + interferon-alfa-2b has not undergone formal phase II testing. In a small pilot study, a 5 consecutive day schedule of 5-FU and interferon-alfa-2b resulted in the limiting toxicities of diarrhea and mucositis. A more limited schedule was recommended. Therefore, it is reasonable to examine such a schedule. In the current study, 5-FU will be followed by interferon-alfa-2b daily for 3 days to attempt to benefit from both the biochemical and immunologic mechanisms described above."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gastrointestinal Cancer Metastatic","Renal Cell Cancer Metastatic","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic"],"keywords":["Metastatic Gastrointestinal","Metastatic Kidney","Metastatic Lung"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":18,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"5-Fluorouracil and Interferon","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"5-Fluorouracil\n\nInterferon-alfa-2b","interventionNames":["Drug: 5-Fluorouracil and Interferon"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"5-Fluorouracil and Interferon","description":"5-Fluorouracil Interferon-alfa-2b","armGroupLabels":["5-Fluorouracil and Interferon"],"otherNames":["5FU and Interferon"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression Free Survival","description":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) was calculated as the time (months) from date of the start of treatment to the date of first observed disease progression (per standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.
