The purpose of this study is to see if adding the drug apricoxib to standard chemotherapy is effective in treting NSCLC. Apricoxib is an investigational drug. Investigational means that it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Laboratory studies suggest that apricoxib may be useful in the treatment of cancer . This is seen particularly when it is combined with chemotherapy drugs. However, this has not been proven in humans.\n\nLaboratory evidence indicates that apricoxib may benefit patients whose disease over-produces a substance called COX-2. COX-2 can be detected in the urine as a substance called PGE-M (prostaglandin E metabolite). It is thought that patients who have a PGE-M level in the urine that decreases by at least half after taking apricoxib may benefit more than patients whose urine PGE-M decreases by less than half after apricoxib.\n\nThis study evaluated whether adding apricoxib to standard chemotherapy treatment will improve outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose urine PGE-M decreases at least 50% after taking apricoxib. Apricoxib or placebo was added to either docetaxel or pemetrexed treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["apricoxib","docetaxel","pemetrexed","Stage IIIb or Stage IV"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":109,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Apricoxib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Apricoxib 400mg once a day","interventionNames":["Drug: apricoxib","Drug: Docetaxel or Pemetrexed"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo once a day","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo","Drug: Docetaxel or Pemetrexed"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"apricoxib","description":"Oral apricoxib tablets will be provided as white or off-white film-coated tablets available in 100mg strength to be taken every day","armGroupLabels":["Apricoxib"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Oral placebo tablets will be provided as white or off-white film-coated tablets to be taken every day","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel or Pemetrexed","description":"Docetaxel 75mg/m2 or Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 given as an IV infusion every 21 days.
