The objective of this study was to find the dose of LY2603618 that can be safely combined with standard doses of pemetrexed and cisplatin and to test if this triplet offered a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with Stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line of palliative treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["solid tumors","Mesothelioma","Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase 1: LY2603618 130 to 275 mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cycle 1-2 (21-day cycle):\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 milligrams per meter square (mg/m\\^2) + cisplatin 75 mg/m\\^2\n\nDay 2: LY2603618 at 130-275 milligrams (mg)\n\nAfter 2 cycles, participants may continue on study drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criterion is met.","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Cisplatin","Drug: LY2603618"]},{"label":"Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin + LY2603618","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cycles 1-4 (21-day cycle):\n\nBefore 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m\\^2\n\nDay 2: LY2603618 dose from phase 1 portion of trial\n\nAfter 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m\\^2\n\nAfter 4 cycles, participants may continue on maintenance therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criterion is met.\n\nMaintenance Therapy Experimental Arm (every 21 days):\n\nBefore 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2\n\nDay 2: LY2603618 dose determined from phase 1\n\nAfter 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2\n\nIf, as of 25 Oct 2012, participant was in maintenance therapy and randomized to the experimental arm, the participant is eligible to continue with pemetrexed (Day 1)/LY2603618 (Day 2) therapy if the investigator deems it is in the best interest of the participant and the participant consents.","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Cisplatin","Drug: LY2603618"]},{"label":"Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Cycle 1-4 (21-day cycle):\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m\\^2\n\nAfter 4 cycles, participants may continue on maintenance therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criterion is met.\n\nMaintenance Therapy Comparator Arm: Phase 2 (every 21 days):\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Cisplatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed","description":"Administered intravenously as a continuous 10-minute infusion","armGroupLabels":["Phase 1: LY2603618 130 to 275 mg","Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin + LY2603618"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cisplatin","description":"Administered intravenously as a continuous 1-hour infusion","armGroupLabels":["Phase 1: LY2603618 130 to 275 mg","Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin + LY2603618"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"LY2603618","description":"Administered intravenously as a continuous 1-hour infusion","armGroupLabels":["Phase 1: LY2603618 130 to 275 mg","Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin + LY2603618"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival Time","description":"Progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first date of documented objective progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause.

CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions, and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \\<10 millimeter (mm). PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.","populationDescription":"All randomized Phase 2 participants.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"90% Confidence Interval","unitOfMeasure":"percentage of participants","timeFrame":"Randomization until date of disease progression (up to 6 months after the last participant was randomized)","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin + LY2603618","description":"Cycles 1-4 (21-day cycle):\n\nBefore 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m\\^2\n\nDay 2: LY2603618 dose determined from phase 1 (275 mg)\n\nAfter 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m\\^2\n\nAfter 4 cycles, participants may have continued on maintenance therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criterion was met.\n\nMaintenance therapy (every 21 days):\n\nBefore 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2\n\nDay 2: LY2603618 dose determined from phase 1 (275 mg)\n\nAfter 25 Oct 2012:\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2\n\nIf, as of 25 Oct 2012, the participant was in maintenance therapy and randomized to the experimental arm, the participant was eligible to continue with pemetrexed/LY2603618 therapy if the investigator deemed it was in the participant's best interest and the participant consented.\n\nPemetrexed, cisplatin, and LY2603618 were administered IV over 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 hour, respectively."},{"id":"OG001","title":"Phase 2: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","description":"Cycles 1-4 (21-day cycle):\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m\\^2\n\nAfter 4 cycles, participants may have continued on maintenance therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criterion was met.\n\nMaintenance therapy (every 21 days):\n\nDay 1: pemetrexed 500 mg/m\\^2\n\nPemetrexed was administered IV over 10 minutes, and cisplatin was administered IV over 1 hour."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"39"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23"}]}],"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.6","lowerLimit":"28.0","upperLimit":"60.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.7","lowerLimit":"7.0","upperLimit":"44.0"}]}]}],"analyses":[{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001"],"nonInferiorityType":"SUPERIORITY_OR_OTHER","pValue":"0.0824","pValueComment":"The test of treatment effect was conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.10.","statisticalMethod":"Chi-squared","ciNumSides":"TWO_SIDED"}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Phase 2: Change in Tumor Size","description":"Change in tumor size was based on tumor measurements collected according to RECIST, v1.1 guidelines.
