Pevonedistat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pevonedistat together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer when compared with other standard chemotherapy drugs.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI.
