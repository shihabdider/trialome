The advanced stages are associated with poor survival rates, a median survival rate of approximately 3.9 months if left untreated.\n\nAngiogenesis is a process for wound healing and restoring blood flow to tissues after injury. It is the physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis may be promoted by growth factors and in diseases such as cancer, where growth factors are over expressed, the body loses the ability to maintain a balanced angiogenesis. This may embellish the existing supplies of blood; potentially increasing the delivery of oxygen and nutrients supplies for cancer growth and survival.\n\nRamucirumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor; and is believed to block the promotion of the growth factor to form new blood vessels, thus reducing the blood supply to the cancer cells."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","Lung","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":41,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ramucirumab + paclitaxel + carboplatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin until disease progression, the development of an unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria, for up to six cycles (3 weeks per cycle).\n\nIn the absence of any withdrawal criteria, participants will continue to receive ramucirumab monotherapy every 3 weeks, provided there is ongoing evidence of benefit upon review every 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Biological: Ramucirumab","Drug: Paclitaxel","Drug: Carboplatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Ramucirumab","description":"10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), intravenous (IV) infusion, on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.","armGroupLabels":["ramucirumab + paclitaxel + carboplatin"],"otherNames":["IMC-1121B","LY3009806"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Paclitaxel","description":"200 milligrams per meter squared (mg/m\\^2), administered intravenously (IV) following the ramucirumab infusion, on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for up to six cycles.","armGroupLabels":["ramucirumab + paclitaxel + carboplatin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"Administered after paclitaxel, as an intravenous infusion (IV), over 30 minutes on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for up to six cycles.
