Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cetuximab together with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab together with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab works in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

To evaluate progression-free and overall survival, response rate (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete plus partial), and frequency and severity of non-hemorrhage toxicities in this group of patients treated with this regimen.\n\nII. To perform molecular correlative studies on patient tissue to investigate in an exploratory manner potential predictors of efficacy.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\nINDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over 30 minutes, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
