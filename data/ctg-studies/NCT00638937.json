Saracatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the rate of disease control (i.e., lack of disease progression, a combined rate of objective complete and partial response, and stable disease) for at least 4 cycles of therapy in patients with AZD0530 (saracatinib) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer that had previously been treated with platinum-based combination chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the objective response rate (complete and partial response), stable disease rate, duration of response or stable disease, progression-free, median and 6 month overall survival rates, safety and tolerability of this treatment.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate potential predictive markers by assessing pretreatment intratumoral levels of src, Y419 phospho-src (P-Src) and c-terminal src kinase (Csk) in archival tumor biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\nPatients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nTumor tissue samples are collected at baseline and at 2 weeks after beginning treatment and are analyzed for c-Src protein expression and activity by immunofluorescence staining. P-glycoprotein levels and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, caveolin, and Stat-3 are also measured using tumor tissue samples. Blood samples are also used to measure levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (saracatinib)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive saracatinib PO, at a dose of 175 mg QD on days 1-28.
