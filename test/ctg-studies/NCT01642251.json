Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cisplatin and etoposide with or without veliparib may work better in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer or metastatic large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of veliparib to use in combination with cisplatin and etoposide (CE). (Phase I) II. To determine whether the addition of ABT-888 (veliparib) to cisplatin etoposide (CE) results in improved progression free survival (PFS) over CE with placebo in the frontline therapy of newly diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall survival (OS) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888. (Phase II) II. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) as well as complete response rate (CRR) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888. (Phase II) III. To determine the toxicity profile of the combination of ABT-888 and CE chemotherapy in this patient population. (Phase II)\n\nOTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To conduct exploratory correlative analysis of the impact of the select biomarkers. (Phase II) II. To compare the overall toxicity profile and specifically the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with the addition of ABT-888 to CE. (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.\n\nPhase I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, etoposide intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPhase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM D: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM E: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Large Cell Lung Carcinoma","Neuroendocrine Carcinoma","Small Cell Carcinoma","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer AJCC v7"],"keywords":["Veliparib","Small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":156,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A (veliparib)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1.
