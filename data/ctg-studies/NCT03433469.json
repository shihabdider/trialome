To evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with surgically resectable EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety of osimertinib given as neoadjuvant therapy in early stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC participants.\n\nII. To evaluate whether neoadjuvant osimertinib treatment increases the frequency of tumors that are unresectable due to adverse events or disease progression.\n\nIII. To evaluate secondary measures of clinical efficacy in early stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib induction therapy.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate long-term measures of efficacy in patients treated with osimertinib neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nII. To explore tissue and cell-free biomarkers that may be predictive of response or primary resistance to osimertinib neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgical resection of their cancer.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days then every 3 months for up to 1 year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (osimertinib)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive 80mg osimertinib orally, once a day (PO QD) on days 1-28.
