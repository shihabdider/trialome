Treatment with LDK378 750 mg qd continued until the patient experienced disease progression as determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity that precluded further treatment, pregnancy, start of a new anticancer therapy, discontinued treatment at the discretion of the patient or investigator, lost to follow-up, death, or study was terminated by Sponsor.","detailedDescription":"Study completed as per protocol. 'Switched to commercial drug' implies that after the primary and secondary objectives were achieved, one patient continued the study treatment as they did not meet the progression disease or AE to be discontinued from the treatment.
