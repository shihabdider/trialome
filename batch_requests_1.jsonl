Patients must be at least 28 days since any prior radiation or major surgery.\\n\\nAge greater than 18 years (males or non-pregnant females). Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of BAY 43-9006 in patients less than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if applicable.\\n\\nLife expectancy of greater than 3 months.\\n\\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than 2 (Karnofsky \\\\> 60%).\\n\\nPatients must have adequate organ and marrow function (as defined below).

For this reason and because kinase inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and continue for at least 2 months after completion. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BAY 43-9006, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 43-9006.\\n\\nAbility to comply with daily oral self administration schedule, and the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\\n\\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\\n\\nPatients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 3 months without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.\\n\\nUncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (American Heart Association (AHA) Class II or worse), uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006. HIV positive patients not receiving antiretroviral therapy are excluded due to the possibility that BAY 43-9006 may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to BAY 43-9006.\\n\\nPatients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\\n\\nHistory of another invasive malignancy in the last five years.

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the above agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the agents used in this study. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\\n* Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with carboplatin, paclitaxel and cetuximab or other agents administered during the study.

If any uncertainty remains, the patient will have four-dimensional CT scans (4DCT) in an effort to determine the degree of tumor motion. A freely mobile tumor during ventilation will be judged to be T3 disease.\\n* Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes \\\\<=1cm and no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0. Patients with \\\\>1cm hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or abnormal PET (including suspicious but non-diagnostic uptake) may be eligible if directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer.\\n* Primary tumor must be technically resectable by an experienced thoracic cancer clinician, with a reasonable possibility of obtaining a gross total resection with negative margins (potentially curative resection, PCR). However, patients must have underlying physiological medical problems prohibiting PCR (i.e., problems with general anesthesia, the operation, the post-op recovery period, or removal of adjacent functioning lung) or refuse surgery.

Specifically, patients harboring the most common mutations, deletions in exon 19 or the L858R mutation in exon 21 are eligible. Presence of the known resistance mutation T790M as detected by direct tumor sequencing is not allowed. Other rare EGFR mutations may be eligible after discussion with the overall principal investigator\\n* Age equal to or greater than 18 years\\n* Measurable disease by RECIST criteria, defined as the presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as 10mm or greater with spiral CT scan\\n* ECOG Performance status of 0, 1 or 2\\n* Since prior radiation or surgery, 14 days or more must have elapsed before starting protocol treatment\\n* No prior treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib, or other small molecule EGFR-TKIs. Prior treatment in the adjuvant setting is allowed if at least 1 year has elapsed since TKI course.\\n* Adequate organ function as outlined in the protocol\\n* Patients must undergo a screening eye exam to obtain approval for HCQ treatment, which establishes the absence of baseline conditions include macular degeneration, visual field changes, other retinal disease, and cataracts that interfere with required funduscopic examinations\\n* No G6PD deficiency, as HCQ may cause hemolysis in patients with G6DP\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\n* Symptomatic CNS metastases or newly diagnosed CNS metastases that have not yet been definitively treated with radiation and/or surgery. Note that patients with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowed if they have been definitively treated and are clinically stable. Maintenance steroids are allowed but maintenance seizure medication with an EIAED is not allowed\\n* Prior radiation therapy inclusive of all identified target lesions. Note that prior palliative radiation to bony disease, CNS disease, or a limited thoracic area is allowed, provided that there is measurable disease outside the field and radiation is completed at least two weeks prior to starting treatment and the patient has fully recovered from all side effects\\n* Current use of hydroxychloroquine for any reason\\n* Known hypersensitivity to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or any closely related drug: erlotinib, gefitinib, or any closely related drug\\n* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

If, due to toxicity, the dosing of 1 or more of the components must be reduced, or 1 or more of the components of the regimen must be omitted, or 1 of the components must be replaced with another similar drug, the changed version of the original regimen is not considered a new regimen. However, if a new component, dissimilar to any of the original components, is added to the regimen, the new combination is considered a new regimen. If the treatment is interrupted for surgery or radiotherapy, and then continues with an unchanged schedule and components, that treatment is considered as one regimen despite the interruption.\\n5.

Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1.5 x 10\\\\^9/L, hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dL (a hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL at Screening is acceptable if it is corrected to greater than 9 g/dL by growth factor or transfusion prior to first dose), and platelet count greater than 100 x 10\\\\^9/L;\\n10. Patients must have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN), and alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than 3 x ULN (in the case of liver metastases, less than 5 x ULN). If there are bone metastases, liver-specific alkaline phosphatase may be separated from the total and used to assess liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase;\\n11. Male or female patients of child-producing potential must agree to use double barrier contraception, oral contraceptives, or avoidance of pregnancy measures during the study and for 90 days after the last day of treatment;\\n12. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test;\\n13. Females may not be breastfeeding; and\\n14.
