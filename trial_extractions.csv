A high number of participants experienced any TEAE (e.g., all participants in most cohorts) and a notable proportion experienced TESAEs or Grade 3 or higher TEAEs across both dose-escalation and expansion parts. Specific Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities such as gamma-glutamyl transferase, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and lipase were also reported.",UNCERTAIN,"This clinical trial's primary endpoints were exclusively focused on safety and tolerability (DLTs, AEs, SAEs, laboratory abnormalities) as is common for a First-in-Human, Dose-escalation study. There were no primary efficacy endpoints defined or reported with statistical significance (p < 0.05). While secondary efficacy endpoints (Objective Response, DoR, PFS, OS) were reported, these were not the primary measures for determining efficacy success in this trial."
