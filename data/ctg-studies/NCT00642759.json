One of the standard treatments for advanced NSCLC is the combination of the drugs carboplatin, paclitaxel and Avastin. Paclitaxel can be associated with severe side effects that may make the treatment difficult to tolerate. Some of these side effects are caused by the solution used to dissolve paclitaxel before it can be administered. Abraxane is a different form of paclitaxel that does not need to be dissolved by this solution. Abraxane is approved for the treatment of breast cancer but is not approved to treat NSCLC. We will also be trying to learn more about how the drug Avastin may work to treat cancer.","detailedDescription":"* Participants will receive a single dose of Avastin 2 weeks before they are scheduled to start the combination of carboplatin, Abraxane and Avastin. Before the dose of Avastin is given, a perfusion CT scan and blood work will be performed. The perfusion CT scan and blood draw will be repeated 12 days after teh Avastin dose (2 days before beginning study treatment).\n* The combination of carboplatin, Abraxane and Avastin will be given in 3 week cycles and all drugs will be given as infusions. On day 1, Avastin, Abraxane and carboplatin wil be given. On Day 8 and 15, Abraxane will be given.\n\nParticipants can receive up to 6 cycles of carboplatin, Abraxane and Avastin if their disease does not get worse and they do not experience intolerable side effects.\n\n* The following assessment procedures will be performed on day 1 of each cycle: physical exam; routine urine test (every other cycle); Performance status assessment. Routine blood tests will be performed on days 1, 8 and 15.\n* Additional procedures performed after cycles 2 and 4 and at 6 months after beginning study treatment are as follows: CT scan, PET scan, perfusion CT and blood work.\n* After 6 cycles of carboplatin, Abraxane and Avastin, participants will receive Avastin alone for three weeks. Participants can continue to receive Avastin as long as they do not experience unacceptable side effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["NSCLC","Abraxane","Carboplatin","Bevacizumab","Avastin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chemotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and bevacizumab","interventionNames":["Drug: carboplatin","Drug: Nab-paclitaxel","Drug: Bevacizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"carboplatin","description":"Given by infusion on day 1 of each 3 week cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nab-paclitaxel","description":"Given by infusion once weekly (days 1, 8 and 15) of each three week cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Bevacizumab","description":"IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"6-month Progression Free Survival Rate","description":"Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.","timeFrame":"6 Months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective Response Rate to Carboplatin, Abraxane and Avastin","description":"Objective response rate to carboplatin, Abraxane and Avastin according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[Version 1.0\\]","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"6 Month Survival Rate","description":"The percentage of participants surviving at least six months after baseline","timeFrame":"6 months"},{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"The median overall survival in months","timeFrame":"3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma of non-squamous histology\n* AJCC stage IIIB or Stage IV\n* Measurable disease by RECIST criteria, and must have at least one target lesion 1cm or greater in diameter for optimal perfusion CT scanning\n* No prior chemotherapy treatment or VEGF inhibitor treatment, although prior treatment with EGFR inhibitors will be allowed\n* 18 years of age or older\n* Adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function as outlined in the protocol\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks\n* Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study\n* Inadequately controlled hypertension\n* Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy\n* NYHA Grade II or greater congestive heart failure\n* History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study enrollment\n* History of stroke, transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to study enrollment\n* Symptomatic CNS metastases or newly diagnosed CNS metastases that have not yet been definitively treated with radiation and/or surgery.
