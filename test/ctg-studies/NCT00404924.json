ZD6474 is a new anti-cancer drug in development that works in a different way to standard chemotherapy drugs. It targets the growth of new blood vessels to a tumour and thereby might slow the rate at which the tumour may grow. Early studies indicate that ZD6474 has a positive effect on the time that a tumour may take to progress to a further stage. Approximately 930 patients will take part in this study. It will be conducted in hospitals and clinics in North and South America, Europe and Asia."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma"],"keywords":["Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma","Adenocarcinoma","Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Large Cell Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1140,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Best Supportive Care","interventionNames":["Other: Best Supportive Care"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vandetanib + Best Supportive Care","interventionNames":["Drug: ZD6474 (vandetanib)","Other: Best Supportive Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ZD6474 (vandetanib)","description":"once daily oral tablet","armGroupLabels":["2"],"otherNames":["ZACTIMA™"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Best Supportive Care","description":"standard of care","armGroupLabels":["1","2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization until death.
