Because patients with non-squamous type NSCLC have been shown to have better survival rates than patients with squamous tumors when given pemetrexed with a platinum agent, only patients with non-squamous NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, large cell, and undifferentiated), not including squamous histology, will be allowed to participate in this study.
