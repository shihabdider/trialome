The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a lung cancer specific health-related quality-of life (QoL) questionnaire. Participant response to the question \"Have you had pain in your chest?\" is scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). A higher score indicates a worse level of chest pain. TTD is defined as the time to first onset of 10 or more (out of 100) deterioration from baseline and confirmed by a second adjacent 10 or more deterioration from baseline.","populationDescription":"After additional Futility Analysis of OS was performed before the first efficacy analysis, as per the supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan amendment (effective date: September 16, 2025) it was stated that no further efficacy analyses would be performed, so the originally planned ePRO data are unavailable.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 29 months","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"MK-7684A + Chemotherapy","description":"Participants receive MK-7684A (co-formulation of 200mg pembrolizumab and 200 mg vibostolimab) via intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each cycle (cycle length = 3 weeks) for up to 35 cycles (up to \\~2 years) PLUS paclitaxel IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) OR nab-paclitaxel IV (on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle) and carboplatin IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) for 4 cycles for Squamous NSCLC; PLUS carboplatin IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) or cisplatin IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) for 4 cycles and pemetrexed IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) until progression, intolerable adverse events, or participant/physician decision for Non-squamous."},{"id":"OG001","title":"Pembrolizumab + Chemotherapy","description":"Participants receive pembrolizumab 200 mg via IV infusion on Day 1 of each cycle (cycle length = 3 weeks) for up to 35 cycles (up to \\~2 years) PLUS paclitaxel IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) OR nab-paclitaxel IV (on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle) and carboplatin IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) for 4 cycles for Squamous NSCLC; PLUS carboplatin IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) or cisplatin IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) for 4 cycles and pemetrexed IV (on Day 1 of each cycle) until progression, intolerable adverse events, or participant/physician decision for Non-squamous."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0"}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Experienced One or More Adverse Events (AEs)","description":"The number of participants who experienced an adverse event (AE) will be presented.
