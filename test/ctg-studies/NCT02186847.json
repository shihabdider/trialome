Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Metformin hydrochloride may shrink tumors and keep them from coming back. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy is more effective when given with or without metformin hydrochloride in treating stage III non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether metformin hydrochloride (MET) added to chemoradiotherapy can improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the effects of MET on overall survival (OS), time to local-regional progression (LRP), and time to distant metastasis (DM).\n\nII. Evaluate the effect of MET on chemoradiotherapy toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 \\[CTCAE, v. 4\\]) within 1 year of completion of all treatment.\n\nIII. Collect biospecimens to develop biomarkers of MET activity.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Adenosquamous Lung Carcinoma","Bronchioloalveolar Carcinoma","Large Cell Lung Carcinoma","Lung Adenocarcinoma","Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":170,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chemoradiation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"60 Gy Radiation therapy with concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by consolidation paclitaxel and carboplatin","interventionNames":["Radiation: Radiation Therapy","Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel"]},{"label":"Metformin + Chemoradiation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Metformin plus 60 Gy Radiation therapy with concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by consolidation paclitaxel and carboplatin","interventionNames":["Radiation: Radiation Therapy","Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Metformin","Drug: Paclitaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Radiation Therapy","description":"Radiation therapy (RT) is given in 2 Gy fractions once daily 5 days per week to a total of 30 fractions and 60 Gy.
