Regorafenib is a targeted therapy that works on different cancer pathways to stop the growth of tumor cells and stop them from spreading. Methotrexate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving regorafenib and methotrexate together may work in treating participants with KRAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy.\n\nII. To determine the disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy.\n\nIII. To determine the safety of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate in metastatic KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, assessed as the number of subjects that experience a treatment-emergent adverse event.\n\nIV. To determine the safety of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate in metastatic KRAS-mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, assessed as the number (percent) of participants experiencing any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).\n\nV. To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of methotrexate when combined with regorafenib (i.e., trough and maximum serum concentration \\[Cmax\\]).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and methotrexate PO twice weekly with 2-3 days apart on a 3 week on / 1 week off schedule. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants will come in for an end of study treatment visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["KRAS Gene Mutation","Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm in the Brain","Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer AJCC v7"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":22,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (regorafenib, methotrexate)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants receive regorafenib PO QD on days 1-21, and methotrexate PO twice weekly with 2-3 days apart on a 3 week on/ 1 week off cycle.
