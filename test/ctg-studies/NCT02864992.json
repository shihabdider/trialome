This study also measures a number of other things including safety of the study drug and the side effects, how body processes the study drug, or how the study drug affects your quality of life. The study also has an optional pharmacogenetic research part. Pharmacogenetic research is an important way to try to understand the role of genetics in human disease and how genes impact the effectiveness of drugs, because differences in genes can change the way a person responds to a particular drug.","detailedDescription":"The study included 3 cohorts with one primary endpoint (Objective Response Rate).
