If repeat imaging between 28-56 days following completion of chemoradiation shows no progressive or metastatic disease, the patients will be eligible for enrollment on the study.\n\nRandomization and Stratification:\n\nAt the time of enrollment, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either nivolumab 480mg IV every 4 weeks or the combination of nivolumab 3mg/kg IV every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV every 6 weeks. Consolidation immunotherapy will be continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to a total of 24 weeks.\n\nSubjects will be stratified by stage (IIIA vs. IIIB) and histology (squamous vs. non-squamous).\n\nDose Calculations:\n\nArm 1: The dose of nivolumab will be a fixed dose (not based on subject's weight) at 480mg.\n\nArm 2: The dose of nivolumab will be weight-based at 3mg/kg. The dose of ipilimumab will be weight-based at 1mg/kg.\n\nNivolumab Alone (Arm 1):\n\nArm 1: Nivolumab Administration:\n\nNivolumab 480 mg will be administered as a 60 minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 28 day cycle. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 60 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -five minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 60 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). Treatment will continue for up to 6 cycles, in the absence of prohibitive toxicities or disease progression.\n\nNivolumab Plus Ipilimumab (Arm 2):\n\nArm 2: Nivolumb Administration:\n\nNivolumab 3mg/kg will be administered as a 60 minute IV infusion on Day 1, 15, and 29 of each 42 day cycle. Nivolumab should not be given any earlier than 12 days from the previous dose. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 60 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -five minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 60 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). Treatment will continue for up to 4 cycles, in the absence of prohibitive toxicities or disease progression.\n\nArm 2: Ipilimumab Administration:\n\nIpilimumab 1mg/kg will be administered as a 90 minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 42 day cycle. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 90 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -five minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 60 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). Treatment will continue for up to 4 cycles, in the absence of prohibitive toxicities or disease progression.\n\nOn day 1 of cycle 1, nivolumab will be given first, followed by 30 minutes of monitoring, and then ipilimumab given second, followed by 30 minutes of monitoring. If the subject does not have an infusion reaction during the first cycle, the post-ipilimumab monitoring may be discontinued for subsequent cycles at the discretion of the treating physician. Day 1 monitoring between the nivolumab/ipilimumab infusions will continue throughout all 4 cycles. Post nivolumab monitoring on days 15 and 29 is not mandatory and should follow the guidelines of the local infusion center."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Nivolumab","Ipilimumab","immunotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Open label"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":105,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Nivolumab 480mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles","interventionNames":["Drug: Nivolumab"]},{"label":"Arm 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Nivolumab 240mg IV every 2 weeks PLUS Ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV every 6 weeks for up to 4 cycles (12 doses Nivolumab and 4 doses of Ipilimumab)","interventionNames":["Drug: Nivolumab","Drug: Ipilimumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nivolumab","description":"480mg","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1"],"otherNames":["OPDIVO"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nivolumab","description":"240mg","armGroupLabels":["Arm 2"],"otherNames":["OPDIVO"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ipilimumab","description":"1mg/kg","armGroupLabels":["Arm 2"],"otherNames":["Yervoy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 18-month","description":"Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \\>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) \\>= 20% increase in tumor burden relative to nadir or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), not meet criteria for CR/PR/PD.\n\nPFS is defined as the time from randomization until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by RECIST 1.1 or death as a result of any cause.","timeFrame":"18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause.","timeFrame":"4 years"},{"measure":"Time to Metastatic Disease (TTMD) at 36 Month","description":"TTMD is defined as the time from randomization until evidence of disease outside of the radiated field.
