Fresolimumab may inhibit radiation side effects and block tumor growth through multiple mechanisms. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), is a specialized form of radiation therapy that precisely delivers high dose radiation directly to tumors, thus killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissue. Giving fresolimumab with SABR may work better in treating patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer than treating with SABR alone.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nPhase 1: Evaluate the safe dose of fresolimumab in combination with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients.\n\nPhase 2. Evaluate the rate of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase I) II. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary function. (Phase I) III. Evaluate recurrence rates and progression free survival. (Phase I) IV. Assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of fresolimumab in combination with SABR (optional for patient). (Phase I) V. Evaluate the rate and severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab. (Phase I) VI. Evaluate the severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab. (Phase II) VII. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase II) VIII. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary function. (Phase II) IX. Evaluate recurrence rates and progression free survival. (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of fresolimumab followed by a phase II study.\n\n* Phase 1: A cohort of 5 patients receive the pre-selected dose of 3mg/kg of fresolimumab. If one patient experiences a DLT, an additional 5 patients will be enrolled at 3 mg/kg. If no more patients experience a DLT, then 3 mg/kg will be the dose for the Phase 2 component. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT in the total expanded cohort (or 2 or more patients in the initial cohort experience DLT), then the investigational dose of fresolimumab will be changed to 1 mg/kg. If 2 or more patients in the initial cohort experience DLT before all 5 patients have been enrolled, the remaining patients will receive the lower dose of 1 mg/kg.\n* Phase 2: Patients receive fresolimumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15, and 36 and undergo SABR in 4 fractions between days 8 and 12.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stage IA Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IB Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"(Phase 1) Fresolimumab 3 mg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive fresolimumab 3 mg/kg IV on days 1, 15, and 36 and undergo SABR in 4 fractions between days 8 and 12.","interventionNames":["Biological: Fresolimumab","Radiation: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy"]},{"label":"(Phase 1) Fresolimumab 1 mg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive fresolimumab 1 mg/kg IV on days 1, 15, and 36 and undergo SABR in 4 fractions between days 8 and 12.","interventionNames":["Biological: Fresolimumab","Radiation: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy"]},{"label":"(Phase 2) Fresolimumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Fresolimumab will be administered IV at the dose selected in the preceding Phase 1 on Days 1, 15 and 36 and SABR will be administered in 4 fractions between Days 8 and 12.","interventionNames":["Biological: Fresolimumab","Radiation: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Fresolimumab","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["(Phase 1) Fresolimumab 1 mg/kg","(Phase 1) Fresolimumab 3 mg/kg","(Phase 2) Fresolimumab"],"otherNames":["Anti-TGF-Beta Monoclonal Antibody GC1008","GC1008","Human Anti-TGF-Beta Monoclonal Antibody GC1008","Immunoglobulin G4, anti-(transforming growth factor beta) (human monoclonal GC-1008 heavy chain), disulfide with human monoclonal GC-1008 light chain, Dimer"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy","description":"Undergo SABR","armGroupLabels":["(Phase 1) Fresolimumab 1 mg/kg","(Phase 1) Fresolimumab 3 mg/kg","(Phase 2) Fresolimumab"],"otherNames":["SBRT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of Fresolimumab When Combined With SABR (Phase I)","description":"DLT is defined as CTCAE grade 3 or higher radiation pneumonitis or bronchopulmonary hemorrhage.","timeFrame":"Up to 30 days"},{"measure":"Number of Participants With Late Radiation Induced Fibrosis","description":"Presence of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis is defined as presence of a moderate-to-severe level of fibrosis.
