Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of Chinese scientists and clinician. In the phase III ICOGEN trial, icotinib had non-inferiority efficacy to gefitinib with better safety. This study is studying icotinib to see how well it works in treating patients with fully resected stage IB NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Neoplasms","Squamous Cell Lung Cancer","Adenocarcinoma of the Lung","Adenosquamous Cell Lung Cancer","Large Cell Lung Cancer","Bronchial Neoplasms","Stage IB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":128,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Icotinib 125 mg three times daily (375 mg per day) orally for 12 months.","interventionNames":["Drug: Icotinib"]},{"label":"Observation group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Observation."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Icotinib","description":"Icotinib 125 mg three times daily (375 mg per day) by mouth for 12 months.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"],"otherNames":["BPI-2009","Conmana"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"3-year Disease-Free Survival","description":"3-year DFS was defined as the percentage of patients who were disease free at 3 years. 3-year DFS were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference in 3-year DFS between groups was compared by the Z test.","timeFrame":"From randomization to the time of disease recurrence or death as a result of any cause, assessed up to 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Written informed consent provided.\n* Males or females, Aged 18-75 years.\n* Able to comply with the required protocol and follow-up procedures, and able to receive oral medications.\n* Had completely resected pathological confirmed stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC.\n* EGFR activating mutation in exon 19 or 21.\n* Patient who can start the investigational therapy within 3-6 weeks after the complete resection.\n* ECOG performance status of 0-1.\n* Had a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more.\n* Adequate hematological function, adequate liver function and renal function.\n* Female patients, except those who are postmenopausal or surgically sterilized, must have a negative pre-study serum or urine pregnancy test.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Had had previous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab).\n* Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures.\n* Had a history another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cured in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix and cured epithelial carcinoma of the bladder.\n* Any evidence confirmed tumor recurrence before investigational therapy.\n* Known severe hypersensitivity to icotinib or any of the excipients of this product.\n* Evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease.\n* Eye inflammation not fully controlled or conditions predisposing the subject to this.\n* Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal, or metabolic disease).\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Pregnancy or breast-feeding women.\n* Ingredients mixed with small cell lung cancer patients.\n* History of neurologic or psychiatric disorders.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Si-Yu Wang, MD","affiliation":"Guangdong Province Association Study of Thoracic Oncology","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center","city":"Guangzhou","state":"Guangdong","zip":"510060","country":"China","geoPoint":{"lat":23.11667,"lon":113.25}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"36816343","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Ou W, Li N, Wang BX, Zhu TF, Shen ZL, Wang T, Chang WG, Chang ZH, Hu XX, Pu Y, Ding LM, Wang SY.
