Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as E7389, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.","detailedDescription":"OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the antitumor activity of E7389 (eribulin mesylate), in terms of objective response rate, in patients with recurrent or progressive stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nII. Evaluate the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.\n\nIII. Evaluate the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\nPatients receive eribulin mesylate IV over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed once monthly for at least 6 months and then periodically thereafter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":66,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive 1.4 mg/m2 eribulin mesylate IV over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 8.
