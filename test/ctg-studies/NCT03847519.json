Biopsies obtained PRIOR to the administration of any systemic therapy to treat the subject's tumor (such as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy) will not be permitted for analysis. The tissue sample must be received by the central laboratory vendor prior to enrollment. Fine needle aspirates, Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) or cell blocks are not acceptable.
