Vandetanib is a new type of agent that targets the blood supply to a cancer tumour (through it's anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) properties) and the tumour cells themselves (through it's anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) actions). This study will look at the effects of vandetanib in lung cancer patients who have had their cancer re-appear after treatment with standard chemotherapy.\n\nThis clinical study will test if the vandetanib anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR characteristics can deliver longer improved progression free survival and improved overall survival than docetaxel (Taxotere) alone.\n\nAll patients participating this clinical study will receive treatment with docetaxel, a commonly used treatment for recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIn addition, some patients will also receive vandetanib (ZACTIMA), an anti-EGFR / anti-VEGF agent.\n\nRecent clinical research shows that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition, when used with standard chemotherapy, can lead to increased survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\n\nOther research shows that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, like erlotinib (Tarceva) can also increase overall non-small cell lung cancer survival by killing tumour cells and stopping them from dividing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-small cell lung cancer","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1690,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Docetaxel monotherapy","interventionNames":["Drug: Docetaxel"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vandetanib + Docetaxel","interventionNames":["Drug: Docetaxel","Drug: Vandetanib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel","description":"infusion","armGroupLabels":["1","2"],"otherNames":["TAXOTERE™"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vandetanib","description":"oral","armGroupLabels":["2"],"otherNames":["ZACTIMA™","ZD6474"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Overall Population","description":"Median time (in weeks) from randomisation until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment.
