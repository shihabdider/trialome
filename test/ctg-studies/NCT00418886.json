Clinical research has shown that drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling can increase overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical studies have shown that vandetanib (ZD6474) is an inhibitor of both VEGFR and EGFR signalling. Giving vandetanib may therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells by blocking their blood supply and by stopping them from dividing. This lung cancer study is to investigate if adding vandetanib to Alimta (pemetrexed) is more effective than Alimta (pemetrexed) alone.","detailedDescription":"This randomized phase III non-small cell lung cancer clinical trial is studying the effect of Alimta (pemetrexed) plus vandetanib to see how well the combination works compared to Alimta (pemetrexed) alone in patients who have previously been treated for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["NSCLC","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":698,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo Vandetanib + Pemetrexed","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vandetanib + Pemetrexed","interventionNames":["Drug: Vandetanib","Drug: Pemetrexed"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vandetanib","description":"oral once daily tablet","armGroupLabels":["2"],"otherNames":["ZACTIMA™","ZD6474","SAR390530"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed","description":"intravenous infusion","armGroupLabels":["1","2"],"otherNames":["Pemetrexed disodium","Alimta®"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Overall Population","description":"Median time (in weeks) from randomization until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) assessment.","timeFrame":"RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression"},{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival in the Female Population","description":"Median time (in weeks) from randomization until objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of objective progression) provided death is within 3 months from the last evaluable RECIST assessment.","timeFrame":"RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"The OS is defined as the time from date of randomization until death.
