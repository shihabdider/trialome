Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage IIIB or IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) or adencarcinoma of the lung with BAC features treated with bortezomib.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.\n\nII. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.\n\nIII. Determine predictors of response, based on molecular correlative studies of tumor and blood, in patients with treated with this drug.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy (yes vs no).\n\nPatients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Adenocarcinoma of the Lung","Bronchoalveolar Cell Lung Cancer","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":42,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8.","interventionNames":["Drug: bortezomib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"bortezomib","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["Arm I"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective Response Rate With Bortezomib Evaluated by Both RECIST Criteria and Computer-assisted Image Analysis.","description":"A response rate of 20% or more with bortezomib would be of interest for further evaluation, whereas a response rate of less than 5% would be of no interest.
