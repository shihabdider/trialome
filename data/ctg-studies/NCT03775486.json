During the initial therapy phase, patients will receive treatment with Durvalumab along with the Investigator's choice of platinum-based doublet therapy for squamous NSCLC (nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin or gemcitabine plus carboplatin/cisplatin) and non-squamous NSCLC (nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin or pemetrexed plus carboplatin/cisplatin) for 4 cycles. Patients who have completed 4 cycles and not progressed throughout the initial therapy phase will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the maintenance phase of the study to receive either Durvalumab plus placebo or Durvalumab plus Olaparib maintenance therapy. Patients will receive maintenance treatment until specific discontinuation criteria are met, including clinical disease progression (as assessed by the Investigator) or RECIST 1.1-defined radiological Progressive Disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, and withdrawal of consent. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed until objective disease progression as efficacy assessments.

An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales, each of the function scales, and the global health status/QoL scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30. Higher scores on the global health status and function scales indicate better health status/function.\n\nA high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.","populationDescription":"Full analysis set (maintenance phase)","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","unitOfMeasure":"change from baseline score","timeFrame":"Includes all assessments occurring within the first 12 months of randomization or until disease progression, up to 18 months.","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Durvalumab/Olaparib Combination Therapy","description":"Initial Therapy Phase (up to 4 cycles):\n\nDurvalumab 50 mg/mL intravenous (IV) at a dose of 1500 mg every 3 weeks, and Standard of Care chemotherapy as follows:\n\n* Nab-paclitaxel: 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3-week cycle\n* Carboplatin: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 5 or 6 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle\n* Cisplatin: 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle\n* Gemcitabine: 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle\n* Pemetrexed: 500 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle\n\nFollowed by Maintenance Phase:\n\nDurvalumab 50 mg/mL IV at a dose of 1500 mg every 4 weeks/Olaparib 2 × 150-mg tablets for 300-mg dose twice daily"},{"id":"OG001","title":"Durvalumab/Placebo Therapy","description":"Initial Therapy Phase (up to 4 cycles):\n\nDurvalumab 50 mg/mL intravenous (IV) at a dose of 1500 mg every 3 weeks, and Standard of Care chemotherapy as follows:\n\n* Nab-paclitaxel: 100 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3-week cycle\n* Carboplatin: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 5 or 6 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle\n* Cisplatin: 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle\n* Gemcitabine: 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle\n* Pemetrexed: 500 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle\n\nFollowed by Maintenance Phase:\n\nDurvalumab 50 mg/mL IV at a dose of 1500 mg every 4 weeks/matching placebo for oral tablet twice daily"}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"134"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"135"}]}],"classes":[{"title":"EORTC QLQ-C30: Fatigue","denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"112"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98"}]}],"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.15","spread":"1.327"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.49","spread":"1.456"}]}]},{"title":"EORTC QLQ-C30: Appetite loss","denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"112"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98"}]}],"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.13","spread":"1.613"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.35","spread":"1.779"}]}]}],"analyses":[{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001"],"groupDescription":"EORTC QLQ-C30: Fatigue Estimated difference in adjusted mean change from baseline.","nonInferiorityType":"OTHER","paramType":"Estimated difference in adjusted mean","paramValue":"1.64","ciPctValue":"95","ciNumSides":"TWO_SIDED","ciLowerLimit":"-2.20","ciUpperLimit":"5.47"},{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001"],"groupDescription":"EORTC QLQ-C30: Appetite loss Estimated difference in adjusted mean change from baseline.","nonInferiorityType":"OTHER","paramType":"Estimated difference in adjusted mean","paramValue":"3.22","ciPctValue":"95","ciNumSides":"TWO_SIDED","ciLowerLimit":"-1.46","ciUpperLimit":"7.90"}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Deterioration in EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) QLQ-C30","description":"Disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessed by time to deterioration (for maintenance phase) in EORTC QLQ-C30.\n\nNA is \"not applicable\".
