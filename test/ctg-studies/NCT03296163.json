For subjects with recurrent disease, at least 6 months must have elapsed before randomization from previous adjuvant treatment.\n4. Previous radiation therapy if completed \\>4 weeks before randomization. Palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions is allowed if completed \\>2 weeks of randomization.\n5. Subjects must have at least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion per RECIST version 1.1 (assessed locally).\n6. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 at Screening.\n7. Subjects must have adequate hepatic, renal and hematologic function defined as:\n\n   * Hepatic function: bilirubin level \\<1.5 the upper limit of normal (ULN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels\\<2.5×ULN.\n   * Renal function: serum creatinine level \\<1.5×ULN, calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) \\>50 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula), urine protein to creatinine ratio \\<1. Subjects with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio \\>1 may be enrolled if they have \\<1 g of protein in 24-hour urine collection.\n   * Hematological function: Absolute neutrophil count \\>1.5×109 /L; platelets \\>100×109 /L, hemoglobin (Hb) \\>9 g/dL.\n   * Adequate coagulation parameters such as: INR ≤ 2.0 and aPTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN within 7 days prior to randomization for patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy.\n8. Eligible subjects must have a systolic blood pressure of ≤ 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of ≤90 mm Hg at screening.\n9. Women of childbearing potential, and their partners, must agree to adhere to pregnancy prevention methods throughout the duration of the study (including the Follow-up visits, where applicable). Women of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (did not underwent bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) and not postmenopausal.\n\nSubjects and their partners must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, to avoid women becoming pregnant throughout the course of the study. Medically acceptable forms of birth control can include the following, with approval of the treating physician:\n\n* Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, sexual abstinence.\n\n  10\\.

For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of menopausal status; the length of this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.\n\nIf a female subject is determined not to be postmenopausal, that subject must use adequate contraception, as defined immediately above (inclusion 8).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
