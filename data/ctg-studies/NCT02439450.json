These methods collectively use the body's immune system to target the patient's own tumor. Immunosuppression hinders that response, and may develop in NSCLC patients in a variety of ways, such as activation of checkpoint pathways in the tumor microenvironment. Drugs that disrupt checkpoint molecule signaling like anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab, may release this brake on the immune system. Tumor expression of PD-L1 plays an important role in patient response to checkpoint inhibitors; in general, clinical response to checkpoint inhibitors requires tumor expression of PD-L1 and presence of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL). Combining viagenpumatucel-L with anti-PD-1 agents may enhance the vaccine's anti-tumor activity while prolonging or increasing the efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["lung","cancer","gp96","vaccine","immunotherapy","Heat Biologics","Nivolumab","checkpoint inhibitor"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":121,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 5: Viagenpumatucel-L + Nivolumab CPI Naive","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients naïve to checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy will receive a combination of weekly HS-110 administered as 5 intradermal 0.1 mL injections at a dose of 1 × 107 viable cells/ 0.5 mL for 18 weeks and bi-weekly nivolumab infusions.
