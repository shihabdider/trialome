The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, taking osimertinib and bevacizumab has on the patient and lung cancer. This study will try to find the best dose of osimertinib and bevacizumab given together that does not cause significant side effects. Once the investigators determine that combining osimertinib and bevacizumab is safe, they want to see if the combination is effective in treating lung cancers with the EGFR mutation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","EGFR-mutant Lung Cancers"],"keywords":["Osimertinib","bevacizumab","metastatic","16-033"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":49,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"osimertinib and bevacizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Phase 1:\n\n3+3 dose escalation design 2 dose levels Dose level -1: Osimertinib 40mg daily Maximum accrual = 12 Bevacizumab 15mg/kg q3 weeks Dose level 1: Osimertinib 80mg daily Bevacizumab 15mg/kg q3 Weeks\n\nPhase 2:\n\nUse MTD determined during phase 1","interventionNames":["Drug: osimertinib","Drug: Bevacizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"osimertinib","armGroupLabels":["osimertinib and bevacizumab"],"otherNames":["AZD9291"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Bevacizumab","armGroupLabels":["osimertinib and bevacizumab"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Osimertinib Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (Phase I)","description":"The MTD (maximum tolerated dose)/recommended phase 2 dose will be the highest dose level at which \\<1 DLT is detected in the first cycle for 6 treated patients.
