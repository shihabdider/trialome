The aim of this study is to determine if necitumumab, given together with a standard chemotherapy combination consisting of cisplatin and pemetrexed will be more effective in improving participant disease than the standard chemotherapy combination alone.","detailedDescription":"Multinational, randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study of 633 participants with advanced, nonsquamous (Stage IV) NSCLC. Participants will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive first-line necitumumab plus chemotherapy consisting of pemetrexed and cisplatin in study Arm A, or first-line pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy alone in Arm B.\n\nBaseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 21 days prior to randomization (first treatment will be administered within 7 days following randomization).\n\nParticipants will undergo radiographic assessment (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) of disease status every 6 weeks (± 3 days), until there is radiographic documentation of progressive disease (PD). Chemotherapy will continue for a maximum of six cycles in each arm (Or until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance or withdrawal of consent); participants in Arm A only will continue to receive necitumumab until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent.\n\nAfter the end-of-study-visit (following PD), follow-up information regarding further anticancer treatment and survival will be collected every 2 months (± 7 days). For participants who discontinue study for reasons other than PD (eg, symptomatic deterioration), information on disease progression will also be collected until PD is documented. Follow-up will continue as long as the participant is alive, or until the end of the trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Nonsquamous","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","First line treatment","Monoclonal","Antibodies","Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":633,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Necitumumab + Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Necitumumab + Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Cisplatin","Biological: Necitumumab"]},{"label":"Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Cisplatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed","description":"500 milligram per square meter (mg/m2) administered Intravenously (I.V.) on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle, for a maximum of six cycles","armGroupLabels":["Necitumumab + Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","Pemetrexed + Cisplatin"],"otherNames":["Alimta®","LY231514"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cisplatin","description":"75 mg/m2 administered I.V. on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle, for a maximum of six cycles","armGroupLabels":["Necitumumab + Pemetrexed + Cisplatin","Pemetrexed + Cisplatin"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Necitumumab","description":"800 mg (absolute dose) on Days 1 and 8 of every 3-week cycle, administered as an I.V.","armGroupLabels":["Necitumumab + Pemetrexed + Cisplatin"],"otherNames":["IMC-11F8","LY3012211","Portrazza®"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival Time (OS)","description":"OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.
