It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of cancer or for any use outside of research studies.\n\nIt has been found that some people with NSCLC have a change (mutation) in a certain gene called the EGFR gene. This mutated gene helps cancer cells grow. The majority of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations achieve good outcomes with erlotinib or other EGFR inhibitor therapies, with a high response rate, prolonged progression-free survival and possibly improved overall survival from therapy. However, the 4% of EGFR mutant patients that harbor an exon 20 insertion mutation historically have reaped little benefit from EGFR-directed therapy due to the low affinity of this mutation for direct EGFR inhibitors, especially erlotinib and gefitinib (see Yasuda et al, Lancet Oncol 2011). This group of patients is ideal for studying other targeted therapeutic strategies that could affect the oncogene mutation in EGFR via alternative mechanisms.\n\nAUY922 is an investigational drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that AUY922 may be effective in killing cancer cells in patients with exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to test the safety of AUY922 and determine how well AUY922 works for participants with advanced NSCLC and exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR.","detailedDescription":"Interested patients will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that they are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that patients do not take part in the research study. If patients have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history physical exam, performance status, assessment of tumor, EKG, electrocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan, eye exam, blood draw, blood pregnancy test, urine test and collection of a piece of the stored tumor tissue.\n\nThe study treatment is given in 21 day cycles. AUY922 is given by IV (into a vein). This is called an infusion. Patients will receive an infusion of AUY922 on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle (once per week). The infusion will take about 60 minutes.\n\nA schedule of clinic visits for the study is summarized below.\n\nCycle 1, Day 1: physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight; performance status; EKG; blood draw; routine urine test Cycle 1, Day 2: EKG Cycle 1, Day 3: EKG Cycle 1, Day 8: Vital signs, performance status, EKG, questions about side effects and other medications taken Cycle 1, Day 15: Physical exam, including measurement of vital signs, performance status; EKG; blood draw; questions about side effects and other medications taken Note that in Cycle 1 patients will need to stay at (or return to) the clinic for the last EKG following the Day 1 AUY922 infusion, and come to the clinic on Days 2 and 3 for EKGs.\n\nCycle 2 and beyond, Day 1: physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight; performance status; EKG; blood draw; questions about side effects and other medications taken; routine urine test Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 8: Vital signs; performance status; EKG; questions about side effects and other medications taken Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 15: Physical exam, including measurement of vital signs; performance status; EKG; blood draw; questions about side effects and other medications taken.\n\nAdditional EKGs may be done at any time if the study doctor thinks it is necessary. A blood test to measure the amount of cardiac enzymes in the blood may be done whenever abnormal findings are suspected or seen on the EKG.\n\nAdditional tests and procedures:\n\n* CT or MRI scans will be done to measure the disease about every 6 weeks.\n* A blood pregnancy test, for women who can become pregnant, will be performed every 6 weeks or at any point in which pregnancy is suspected.\n* A standard eye exam will be done on Cycle 3, Day 1. Additional eye exams will be done if patients experience any eye-related symptoms, such as changes in vision.\n\nWithin 1 week after the last dose of the study drug AUY922, patients will be asked to return to the clinic. At this visit the following will be done: physical examination, performance status, EKG, ECHO or MUGA scan, blood draw, urine test, eye exam, questions about side effects and other medications taken. Patients will be asked to return to the clinic a second time so investigators can follow-up on any ongoing side effects after stopping AUY922."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Advanced disease","EGFR mutation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AUY922 Treatment Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"AUY922 administered once weekly via intravenous, 70 mg/m2","interventionNames":["Drug: AUY922"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"AUY922","description":"AUY922 administered intravenously once a week at 70mg/m2","armGroupLabels":["AUY922 Treatment Arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Response Rate","description":"The number of participants that achieved a response to treatment as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria is Solid Tumors (RECIST).
