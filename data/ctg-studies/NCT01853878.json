The participants were no longer enrolled in the study, the follow ups on subjects were stopped and the collection and analysis of samples for further research purposes was stopped.\n\nAfter the stop to recruitment, the study was unblinded, as per the amended protocol, the study treatment was continued and completed with the subjects of the active treatment group who were willing to continue. Subjects in the placebo group were withdrawn.\n\nThere was no longer an active follow-up of patients after discontinuation or completion of the treatment. The study ended 30 days after the last dose was administered.\n\nAs a result, primary and secondary objectives were not assessed as planned. All clinical and safety data collected in the study were analysed descriptively. For each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet, testing was not performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remained relevant despite the premature termination of the study.","detailedDescription":"During the treatment period, safety monitoring continued as initially foreseen. Reporting of post-study adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) continued as per protocol. In the best interest of the patient, no more biological samples for protocol research purposes (i.e. serum sampling for humoral immunity, whole blood sampling for pharmacogenetics) were taken."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell"],"keywords":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Immunotherapy","Antigen-Specific"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":137,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GSK2302032A Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients received 13 administrations GSK2302032A product, as per the following schedule: For the first five doses: 1 dose every 3 weeks.
