Patients will be given Pembrolizumab as maintenance up to 2 years: Carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Pembrolizumab every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel or pemetrexed every 3 weeks x 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 2 years.","detailedDescription":"While a genotype-directed strategy has been established as effective in treatment selection for patients with advanced NSCLC, only a minority of patients at this time will have a readily identifiable actionable molecular target. Furthermore, genotype-directed therapy has not been validated for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Therefore, the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC will continue to rely on standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Given the plateau in effectiveness of this approach, novel treatment strategies are clearly warranted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":91,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"For Squamous Carcinoma Carboplatin AUC = 6 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles\n\nOR\n\nFor Non-squamous Carcinoma Carboplatin AUC = 6 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles","interventionNames":["Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel","Drug: Pemetrexed"]},{"label":"Arm B","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"MK-3475 200 mg/m2 IV every 21-days for up to 4 cycles\n\nPatients with CR, PR, or SD by irRC will then be treated with:\n\nFor Squamous Carcinoma:\n\nCarboplatin AUC = 6 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles\n\nOR\n\nFor Non-squamous Carcinoma\n\nCarboplatin AUC = 6 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV day 1 every 21-days for up to 4 cycles","interventionNames":["Drug: MK-3475","Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel","Drug: Pemetrexed"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"MK-3475","description":"Dose frequency of Q3W, Day 1 of each cycle","armGroupLabels":["Arm B"],"otherNames":["Pembrolizumab"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"Dose frequency of Q3W, Day 1 of each cycle (standard Chemotherapy)","armGroupLabels":["Arm A","Arm B"],"otherNames":["Paraplat","Paraplatin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Paclitaxel","description":"Dose frequency of Q3W, Day 1 of each cycle (standard Chemotherapy)","armGroupLabels":["Arm A","Arm B"],"otherNames":["Taxol"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed","description":"Dose frequency of Q3W, Day 1 of each cycle (standard Chemotherapy)","armGroupLabels":["Arm A","Arm B"],"otherNames":["Alimta"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1","description":"The primary objective of this randomized phase II trial to determine the overall response rate (ORR per RECIST 1.1) in Chemotherapy naive patients with stage IV NSCLC after the administration of standard platinum-based chemotherapy before MK-3475 (arm A) and administration of MK-3475 administered before standard platinum-based chemotherapy (arm B).
