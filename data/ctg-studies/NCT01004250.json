Approximately 110 participants will be enrolled into the study, with the aim of having 100 evaluable participants. Eligible participants will first receive 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy with pemetrexed-cisplatin-bevacizumab. Participants who achieve a response or do not progress after completion of induction chemotherapy and have an adequate performance status will receive maintenance therapy with pemetrexed-bevacizumab. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. When treatment is discontinued, the participants health status will be monitored till death, loss to follow-up or data cut-off date.\n\nParticipants who continue to receive benefit from treatment at the time of data cut-off may receive continued access to pemetrexed and bevacizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other reason at investigator or participants decision."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":109,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Cisplatin","Drug: Bevacizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed","description":"500 milligram per square meter (mg/m²) given intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for four cycles of Induction Therapy, and continued in Maintenance Therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity.","armGroupLabels":["Study Treatment"],"otherNames":["Alimta","LY231514"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cisplatin","description":"75 mg/m² given intravenously on Day 1 of 21-day cycle for a maximum of 4 cycles","armGroupLabels":["Study Treatment"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Bevacizumab","description":"7.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) given intravenously on Day 1 of 21-day cycle for four cycles of Induction Therapy, and continued in Maintenance Therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity","armGroupLabels":["Study Treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival","description":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of study enrollment to the first date of objectively determined PD or death from any cause.
