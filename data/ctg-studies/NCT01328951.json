Participants will be randomized to receive either erlotinib 150 milligrams (mg) orally (PO) once daily or placebo. Participants who progress on placebo will receive erlotinib 150 mg PO once daily as second-line therapy, and those who progress on erlotinib may switch to a non-investigational, second-line chemotherapy.
