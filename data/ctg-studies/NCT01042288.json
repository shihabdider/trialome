Patients with stage IIIB disease should be ineligible for combined modality therapy (i.e., pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, etc.).\n4. At least one unidimensionally measurable lesion definable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. Measurable disease is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\n5. Demonstration of K-ras wild type in archived tumor tissue. Tissue must be available for testing or results from previous K-ras testing must be available at the time of registration.\n6. No prior antineoplastic chemotherapy for metastatic lung cancer. Patients may have received adjuvant treatment for stage I, II or III disease.\n7.

Patients must have completed any previous radiotherapy at least four weeks prior to study entry and recovered from any toxicity associated with radiotherapy. Patients must have no on-going requirement for and must have discontinued corticosteroids.\n5. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n6. A serious active infection at the time of treatment or other serious underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.\n7. Acute hepatitis or known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n8. Presence of third space fluid which is clinically significant and cannot be controlled by drainage.\n9. History of interstitial lung disease (e.g., pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or any evidence of interstitial lung disease on baseline chest CT scan).\n10. History of any medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risks associated with the study participation or investigational product(s) administration or may interfere with the interpretation of the results.\n11. Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents used in study (e.g., carboplatin, pemetrexed).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"David R Spigel,
