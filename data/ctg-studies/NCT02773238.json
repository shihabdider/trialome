PET/CT imaging mid-way through treatment may be able to accurately show how well radiation therapy and chemotherapy are working. SPECT/CT imaging may be able to tell which parts of the lung tissue are healthier than others. Based on the result of the imaging, treatment adjustments may be made to the radiation therapy to improve survival and decrease toxicity.","detailedDescription":"OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of radiation therapy.\n\nPatients undergo functional avoidance radiation therapy during weeks 1-3. Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F-18 FDG PET/CT at baseline, 3 weeks, and 3 months post-radiation therapy and undergo technetium Tc-99m albumin aggregated (99mTc-MAA) and technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid SPECT/CT radiation therapy at baseline and 3 months post-radiation therapy. Baseline PET/CT must be performed at University of Washington Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and be within one month of treatment start, therefore some patients may need to repeat a baseline PET/CT if their PET/CT is from an outside institution or \\> 1 month old. Patients not responding to treatment at 3 weeks, will receive an increased daily radiation therapy dosage.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stage IIB Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma AJCC v7","Stage IIIA Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7","Stage IIIB Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":51,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo functional avoidance radiation therapy during weeks 1-3.
