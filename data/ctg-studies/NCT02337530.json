Patients may have received vaccines, immunotherapy or other agents that are not MEK/tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting or for advanced or metastatic disease.\n\nPrior adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy or combined chemoradiotherapy with curative intent is permissible provided completed at least one year prior to enrollment. No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced / metastatic disease is permissible.\n\n\\- Laboratory Requirements (must be done within 7 days prior to randomization)\n\nNeutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10\\^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10\\^9/L\n\nBiochemistry:\n\nCreatinine Clearance\\* ≥ 50 ml/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN (if liver metastases ≤ 5x UNL permissible providing ALP also ≤ 6 x UNL)\n\n\\* Creatinine clearance to be measured directly by 24 hour urine sampling or as calculated by appropriate formula below: Females: GFR = 1.04 x (140-age) x weight in kg/serum creatinine in μmol/L Males: GFR = 1.23 x (140-age) x weight in kg/serum creatinine in μmol/L\n\n* Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate\n* Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients randomized on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre\n* In accordance with CCTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient randomization\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a history of other untreated malignancies or malignancies which required therapy within the past 2 years\n* No symptomatic brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Patients with asymptomatic brain/spinal cord metastasis who are not planned for radiation, or who have been treated and are stable off steroids (or on a decreasing dose) and anticonvulsants are eligible.\n* Patients with significant cardiac disease, including:\n* any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events (e.g. heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age) or mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) \\> 470 msec\n* uncontrolled hypertension (BP ≥ 150/95 mmHg despite medical therapy)\n* acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment\n* angina Canadian Cardiovascular Society Grade II-IV (despite medical therapy)\n* symptomatic heart failure (NYHA II-IV)\n* prior or current cardiomyopathy\n* atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate \\> 100 bpm at rest\n* severe valvular heart disease Patients with cardiac disease, who do not meet the exclusion criteria above, must have a baseline LVEF ≥ 50%.\n* Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, active infection, active bleeding diatheses or renal transplant, including any patient known to have hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n* Patients who have neuropathy \\> grade 1 or other conditions precluding treatment with the standard chemotherapy regimen planned. Consult CCTG for patients with localised neuropathies as such patients may be eligible.\n* Patients who have significant gastrointestinal disease and who are unable to swallow capsules.\n* Patients on potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 (must have discontinued within 2 weeks prior to randomization or 3 weeks for St. John's Wort). Patients who do not agree to avoid the ingestion of large amounts of grapefruit and Seville oranges (and other products containing these fruits, e.g. grapefruit juice or marmalade) and not take vitamin E supplements or multivitamin supplements.\n\nPatients who require oral anticoagulants (Coumadin) are eligible provided there is increased vigilance with respect to INR monitoring upon initiation of dosing with selumetinib. If medically appropriate and treatment available, the investigator should consider switching these patients to LMW heparin.\n\n* Patients with current or past history of central serous retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion, high intraocular pressure (≥ 21mm) or uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP). Patients with visual symptoms should undergo ophthalmologic examination prior to randomization.\n* Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test proven negative within 7 days prior to randomization. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception\n* Patients who do not agree to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection.\n* Selumetinib-specific precautions for patients of Asian ethnicity:\n\nPlasma exposure of selumetinib (Cmax and AUC) is higher, at a population level, in subjects of Asian descent by approximately 1.5- to 2-fold in non-Japanese Asians and Japanese subjects, compared with Western subjects. However, there is overlap in the range of exposure experienced by Asian and Western subjects and the higher average plasma exposure was not associated with a change in the tolerability profile of single dose selumetinib.\n\nInvestigators should make a clinical judgment as to whether the potential risk of experiencing higher selumetinib plasma exposure and potential adverse events outweighs the potential benefit of treatment with selumetinib.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Penelope A Bradbury","affiliation":"Univ.
