Primary study objectives were to determine the recommended combination dose (RCD) and safety and tolerability of the combination. Further objectives were to evaluate the clinical efficacy and biologic activity of the combination.","detailedDescription":"Prior to initiation of combination therapy with ensartinib plus durvalumab, subjects were enrolled sequentially to receive ensartinib monotherapy (orally once daily) during a pre-immunotherapy Run-in Period for one to two 28-day cycles. The purpose of the Run-in Period was to determine whether any safety signals might compromise combination therapy and to determine the effect of ALK inhibitor therapy on the immune tumor microenvironment. For subjects with no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the Run-in Period, combination therapy was then initiated during a dose-finding phase using a standard 3 + 3 design until determination of the RCD, which was defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 of 6 subjects (i.e., \\< 33%) experienced DLTs during the first 2 cycles of combination treatment.\n\nA fixed dose of durvalumab (1500 mg by intravenous \\[IV\\] infusion every 4 weeks) was administered in all cohorts. Ensartinib dosing started at 200 mg, with subsequent cohorts receiving a reduced (150 mg) or escalated (225 mg) ensartinib dose depending upon observed toxicity. The study was then designed to include an expansion phase, in which the RCD cohort would be expanded to a total of 20 subjects.\n\nSubjects were monitored for safety (including immune-related adverse events), disease status (using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] version 1.1 and immune-related RECIST), and biologic activity (peripheral blood assays and immunological changes in the tumor microenvironment) for the duration of study participation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Carcinoma","NSCLC"],"keywords":["ALK-rearranged","ALK-positive","ALK Inhibitor","Ensartinib","X-396","anti-PD-L1","Durvalumab","MEDI4736","ALK"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ensartinib ± Durvalumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects were to receive ensartinib monotherapy during a pre-immunotherapy Run-in Period for one to two 28-day cycles, followed by combination therapy with ensartinib plus durvalumab for subjects with no DLTs during the Run-in Period.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ensartinib","Drug: Durvalumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ensartinib","description":"Ensartinib was administered orally once daily at a dose of 200 mg during the Run-in Period.

The following age-specific requirements applied:\n   * Females \\<50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).\n   * Females ≥50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year prior to study entry, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses \\>1 year prior to study entry, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).\n\n   Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational products. Male subjects were to refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. Female partners (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method of contraception (see table below) throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point was to be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of birth control.\n\n   A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g. male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation was not the primary mode of action \\[excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective\\]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).\n9.

Subjects positive for hepatitis C antibody were eligible only if polymerase chain reaction was negative for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid.\n11. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or components of the study drugs.\n12. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders).\n13. Mental impairment that may have compromised compliance with the requirements of the study.\n14. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical follow-up assessment.\n15. Inability to swallow or retain oral medication, presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that would have interfered significantly with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of ensartinib.\n16. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have put the subject at unacceptable risk.\n17. History of allogeneic organ transplant.\n18.
