The aim of this study is to determine if necitumumab, given together with a standard chemotherapy combination consisting of cisplatin and gemcitabine will be more effective in improving participant disease than the standard chemotherapy combination alone.","detailedDescription":"Multinational, randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase III study of 1093 participants (age ≥ 18 years) with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed, stage IV squamous-cell NSCLC, who have received no prior therapy for metastatic disease, will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive first-line necitumumab plus chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and cisplatin in study Arm A, or gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy alone in study Arm B. Baseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 21 days prior to randomization (first treatment will be administered within 7 days following randomization). Participants will undergo radiographic assessment of disease status (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) every 6 weeks (± 3 days), until there is radiographic documentation of progressive disease (PD). Chemotherapy will continue for a maximum of six cycles in each arm (or until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance or withdrawal of consent); participants in Arm A only will continue to receive necitumumab until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent.\n\nAfter the end-of-study-visit (following PD), follow-up information regarding further anticancer treatment and survival will be collected every 2 months (± 7 days). For participants who discontinue study for reasons other than PD (eg, symptomatic deterioration), information on disease progression will also be collected until PD is documented. Follow-up will continue as long as the participant is alive, or until the end of the trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Squamous","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","First line treatment","Monoclonal","Antibodies","Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1093,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Necitumumab + Gemcitabine + Cisplatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Necitumumab: 800 milligrams (mg) I.V. infusion on Days 1 and 8 of every 3 week cycle.\n\nContinues until progressive disease, toxicity, noncompliance, or withdrawal.\n\nGemcitabine: 1250 milligrams/square meter (mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8 of every 3 week cycle.\n\nContinues for a maximum of six cycles.\n\nCisplatin: 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of every 3 week cycle.
