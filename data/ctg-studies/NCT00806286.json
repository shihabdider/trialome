In the safety portion of the study, subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer will be treated with study drug (CS-7017) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel to evaluate safety. In the Phase 2 portion of the study, subjects will receive study drug (CS-7017) or placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel to evaluate effectiveness and safety.
