Azacitidine and entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine together with entinostat may kill more tumor cells.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess safety, characterize toxicities, and determine the maximum tolerated dose of 5-AZA (azacitidine) with a fixed-dose of entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To determine the objective response rate of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent NSCLC. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent NSCLC.\n\nII. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of 5-AZA and entinostat on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, histone acetylation, and gene re-expression in patients with recurrent NSCLC through analysis of blood, sputum and tissue biopsies.\n\nIII. To explore the effect of 5-AZA and entinostat on progression-free and overall survival in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIV. To explore the differing response rates and progression-free survivals of two schedules of 5-AZA and entinostat in patients with recurrent advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of azacitidine followed by an open-label, phase II study.\n\nPatients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat orally (PO) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":94,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase I - 30mg/m2 Azacitidine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive Azacitidine 30mg/m2 SQ and entinostat 7mg PO on days 3 and 10 of each cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: Azacitidine 30mg/m2","Drug: Entinostat"]},{"label":"Phase I - 40mg/m2 Azacitidine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive azacitidine 40mg/m2 SQ and entinostat 7mg PO on days 3 and 10 of each cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: Entinostat","Drug: Azacitidine 40mg/m2"]},{"label":"Phase II Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive azacitidine 40mg/m2 subcutaneously (SQ) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat 7mg PO on days 3 and 10.
