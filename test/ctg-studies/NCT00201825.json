This drug is Food and Drug Administration approved in combination with cisplatin (Platinol) for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients who have not previously had chemotherapy for this condition. Docetaxel is also approved for second line treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Research indicates that capecitabine, in combination with docetaxel, has efficacy against NSCLC. Capecitabine appears to have anti-cancer activity through several enzymes. This drug is metabolized in the body to another agent called 5-FU. During this conversion process, 5-FU requires thymidine phosphorylase (TP), a cellular characteristic associated with tumor growth. There are higher levels of TP expression in tumors as compared to normal tissue. The drug administration schedule in this study is designed to optimize efficacy against the TP target through both docetaxel and capecitabine. This study will measure biological changes to TP and other enzymes to help researchers gain more information about how capecitabine and docetaxel works against NSCLC.\n\nPurpose: This study will evaluate the efficacy of docetaxel and capecitabine in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC. Tests related to tumor biology will be conducted before and during study treatments and correlated with patient responses to therapies.\n\nTreatment: Patients in this study will receive docetaxel and capecitabine. Docetaxel will be administered through intravenous infusions. Capecitabine will be provided through oral pills. A four-week period constitutes one cycle. Docetaxel will be given weekly for three weeks followed by one week of rest. Capecitabine will be taken twice daily on days 5 through 14 of the treatment cycle. Several tests and exams will be given throughout the study to closely monitor patients. Treatments will be discontinued due to disease growth or unacceptable side effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma"],"keywords":["Previously Untreated","Advanced"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Docetaxel and Capecitabine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Capecitabine","Drug: Docetaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Capecitabine","description":"1250 mg/m2/day in 2 oral daily divided doses of 625 mg/m2 on day 5 of every cycle and continued for 14 days.","armGroupLabels":["Docetaxel and Capecitabine"],"otherNames":["Xeloda"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel","description":"36 mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Docetaxel and Capecitabine"],"otherNames":["Taxotere"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Determine Objective Response Rate","description":"Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \\>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.","timeFrame":"Every 35 days"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time to Tumor Progression","timeFrame":"Every 35 days"},{"measure":"One Year Survival","timeFrame":"one year"},{"measure":"Pharmacokinetics","timeFrame":"Cycle 2"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Must have advanced NSCLC\n* No prior chemotherapy\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG)Performance Status:0 or 1\n* Must have measurable disease (RECIST criteria)\n* life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n* adequate organ function including\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or lactating women\n* Psychiatric disorders that would interfere w/consent or follow-up\n* Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, defined as random blood sugar \\> 250mg/dL.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Tony Bekaii-Saab","affiliation":"Ohio State University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Ohio State University","city":"Columbus","state":"Ohio","zip":"43210","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":39.96118,"lon":-82.99879}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23079156","type":"RESULT","citation":"Bertino EM, Bekaii-Saab T, Fernandez S, Diasio RB, Karim NA, Otterson GA, Villalona-Calero MA.
