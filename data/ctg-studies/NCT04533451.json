Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy may shrink the tumor in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"The primary and secondary objectives of the study:\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To estimate the adverse event profile of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in non-small cell lung cancer patients who are age 70 years of age or older and who are treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) +/- chemotherapy in a first-line setting.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate overall survival. II. To describe patient quality of life during the treatment using the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) questionnaire.\n\nIII. To explore whether Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) -derived risk score is able to predict rates of severe adverse events in older cancer patients who receive MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) + chemotherapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nGROUP B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes, pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes, and carboplatin IV per institutional guidelines on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for up to 5 years after registration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinoma","Metastatic Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Lung Adenocarcinoma","Recurrent Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma","Stage IV Lung Cancer AJCC v8","Stage IVA Lung Cancer AJCC v8","Stage IVB Lung Cancer AJCC v8"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":101,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A (pembrolizumab)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
