Also, currently there are no defined markers that predict for clinical benefit to Avastin. Preliminary studies show that there are several observations that support the concept of metronomic chemotherapy with or without the combination of an anti-angiogenic agent. The metronomic chemotherapy with Avastin was shown to enhance the clinical endpoints of the study (response rate and progressive-free survival). Proof of metronomic scheduling requires the development of appropriate intermediate surrogate markers. Several markers will be assessed.","detailedDescription":"This is a non-randomized, open-label, pilot Phase II study of metronomic chemotherapy plus Avastin in chemo naïve subjects with advanced non-squamous, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the overall progression-free survival.\n\nSubjects will be treated with metronomic chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks, and Avastin will be administered every 2 weeks. Treatment with metronomic chemotherapy will be expressed as a 4-week cycle. Tumor response to treatment will be evaluated every 8 weeks.\n\nTreatment with metronomic chemotherapy and Avastin will continue for a total of 6 cycles unless there is evidence of disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Maintenance therapy with Avastin will then continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.\n\nPotential biologic parameters to monitor anti-tumor activity of metronomic chemotherapy will be evaluated in 10 subjects. These biomarkers include: sequential determination of blood levels of VEGF, VEGFR2, thrombospondin-1, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and circulating endothelial cells and endothelial precursor cells."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Lung Cancer","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Metronomic Chemotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine + Avastin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will be treated with metronomic chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine weekly for 3 out of 4 weeks which constitutes one cycle (4 weeks).
