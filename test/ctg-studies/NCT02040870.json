The first 15 patients to be enrolled in the study will have PK sampling over 120-hour during the 5-day PK run-in period following a single oral dose at 750 mg. After the PK run-in period, the treatment period will start in which LDK378 will be given starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 in a continuous daily oral dosing in 28-day cycles. Separated from these 15 patients, the rest of the enrolled patients will receive LDK378 treatment at 750 mg QD on Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\nTumor response will be evaluated every 8 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles) starting from the first day of treatment with LDK378 until the time of RECIST-defined PD by investigator assessment, withdrawal of consent for further follow-up, loss to follow-up or death."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-Small Cell lung Cancer","NSCLC","ALK","LDK378","ALK-rearranged","ALK-positive","advanced non-small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":103,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LDK378","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"daily dosing, 28-day cycle patients","interventionNames":["Drug: LDK378"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"LDK378","description":"750 mg once daily","armGroupLabels":["LDK378"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Primary Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameters of of LDK378 After Daily Oral Dose: AUClast, AUC0-24h, AUCinf","description":"AUClast: The area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration time.\n\nAUC0-24h: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated from time zero to 24 hours.\n\nAUCinf: Area under the plasma (serum, or blood) concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity","timeFrame":"PK run-in phase (0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h after PK run-in dose and predose Cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1)(approximately 120h after PK run in dose))"},{"measure":"Primary Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of of LDK378 After Daily Oral Dose: AUC0-24h","description":"AUC0-24h: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated from time zero to 24 hours.","timeFrame":"Cycle 2 Day 1 (after one cycle (28 days) of continous dosing)(0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h , 6h , 8h and 24h)"},{"measure":"Primary Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of LDK378 After Daily Oral Dose: Cmax","description":"Cmax is the maximum (peak) concentration of drug in plasma","timeFrame":"PK run-in phase (0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h after PK run-in dose and predose Cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1)(approximately 120h after PK run in dose)) and C2D1(after one cycle (28 days) of continous dosing)(0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h , 6h , 8h and 24h)"},{"measure":"Primary Pharmacokinetics (PK) Parameter of LDK378 After Daily Oral Dose: Tmax","description":"Tmax is the time to reach maximum plasma concentration.","timeFrame":"PK run-in phase (0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h after PK run-in dose and predose Cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1)(approximately 120h after PK run in dose)) and C2D1(after one cycle (28 days) of continous dosing)(0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h , 6h , 8h and 24h)"},{"measure":"Overall Summary of Adverse Events (AEs) - Per Occurence","description":"Safety and tolerability of LDK378 at 750 mg once daily dose in Chinese adult patients with ALK-rearranged locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC","timeFrame":"up to 41 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 Per Investigator Assessment","description":"ORR calculated as the percentage of participants with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).
