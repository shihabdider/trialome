The primary purpose of this study is to see if Sym015 is safe and effective for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies without available therapeutic options.","detailedDescription":"In the first part of the study (Part 1, dose-escalation), Sym015 was evaluated for safety and tolerability. Additionally, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) was to be determined. Sym015 was given at different dose levels on an every second week (Q2W) dosing schedule. Each patient was given one single weight based dose level.\n\nIn the second part of the study (Part 2, dose-expansion), dosing was to be at the RP2D on a Q2W dosing schedule. Three cohorts were included:\n\n* Basket Cohort: Patients with KRAS wild-type (WT) advanced solid tumor malignancies with MET-amplification and without therapeutic options. Patients must have no prior therapy with MET-targeting agents, except a subset of patients having received prior therapy with a MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). As of December 2018, accrual to this cohort was suspended.\n* Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) MET-Amplified Cohort: Patients with advanced NSCLC with MET-amplification, and without available therapeutic options. Patients may have received prior therapy with MET-targeting and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting agents.\n* NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping alteration (METex14del) Cohort: Patients with advanced NSCLC METex14del, and without therapeutic options. Tumors need not be MET-amplified, and patients may have received prior therapy with MET-targeting and/or EGFR-targeting agents."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oncology","MET Gene Amplification","NSCLC","MET Gene Mutation","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies","MET Gene Amplification","MET Amplification","Wild-type","NSCLC","METex14del","Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Arms 1-4 comprises part 1 (dose-escalation), which is an as evaluation of 4 different dose levels (DL), 6, 12, 18, and 24 mg/kg.
