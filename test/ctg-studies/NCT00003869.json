Chemotherapeutic agents are modestly effective for the treatment of advanced lung cancer, with rapid tumor relapse and growth even after initial response to therapy. It is not yet known whether carboxyamidotriazole is more effective than no further treatment after standard chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether oral administration of the carboxyaminoimidazole (CAI) is more effective than placebo in prolonging the overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who have been stable or had tumor regression following chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral CAI following chemotherapy. II. To determine whether CAI prolongs time-to-disease progression relative to a placebo.\n\nIII. To evaluate whether a substantive effect in quality of life (QOL) can be detected between the CAI and placebo groups using the FACT-L and the UNISCALE.\n\nIV. To document the response rate to CAI in patients with measurable or evaluable disease.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate genotypes at GSH-related loci as predictors of overall survival.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to timing of first-line therapy (prior to registration vs after registration), disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB vs IV), therapy components (chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy vs chemotherapy only), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole daily.\n\nARM II: Patients receive oral placebo daily.\n\nTreatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nQuality of life is assessed at baseline and then monthly during study.\n\nPatients are followed every 3 months for 5 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":186,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm I (CAI)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole daily.","interventionNames":["Drug: carboxyamidotriazole","Procedure: quality-of-life assessment","Other: laboratory biomarker analysis"]},{"label":"Arm II (placebo)","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients receive oral placebo daily","interventionNames":["Other: placebo","Procedure: quality-of-life assessment","Other: laboratory biomarker analysis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"carboxyamidotriazole","description":"Given PO","armGroupLabels":["Arm I (CAI)"],"otherNames":["CAI","carboxyamido-triazole","carboxyaminoimidazole"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"placebo","description":"Given PO","armGroupLabels":["Arm II (placebo)"],"otherNames":["PLCB"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"quality-of-life assessment","description":"Ancillary studies","armGroupLabels":["Arm I (CAI)","Arm II (placebo)"],"otherNames":["quality of life assessment"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"laboratory biomarker analysis","description":"Correlative studies","armGroupLabels":["Arm I (CAI)","Arm II (placebo)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"OS was defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause.
