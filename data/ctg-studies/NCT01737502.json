To establish the maximum tolerated dose of auranofin plus sirolimus after at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy for lung cancer (squamous, ras-mutated adenocarcinoma, or small cell lung cancer) patients with no acceptable standard treatment options. (Phase I) II. To assess the progression-free survival at four months of patients treated with auranofin after at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy for lung cancer (squamous, ras-mutated adenocarcinoma, or small cell lung cancer) patients with no acceptable standard treatment options. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the overall survival in this population in comparison to recent historical controls.\n\nII. To determine the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of the regimen. III. To determine the overall response rate, per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, and duration of tumor response in those patients with measurable disease.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the relationship between molecular correlates and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), response and adverse events.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of auranofin followed by a phase II study.\n\nPatients receive auranofin orally (PO) on days 1-28 and sirolimus PO on days 1-28 (days 8-28 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 5 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Lung Adenocarcinoma","Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Recurrent Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":29,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (auranofin and sirolimus)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive auranofin PO on days 1-28 and sirolimus PO on days 1-28 (days 8-28 of course 1).
