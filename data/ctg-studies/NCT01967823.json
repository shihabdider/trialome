In a previous study the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors. In this study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells which we hope will be better in making the tumors shrink.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Patients 15 years old and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on their tumors.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed\n* Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}\n* Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO-1 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n* Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.","detailedDescription":"PRECIS\n\nBackground:\n\n* We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and \\<= chains of a murine T cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes the New York Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO-1) (ESO) tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this T-cell receptor (TCR) with high efficiency.\n* In co-cultures with human leukocyte antigen serotype within the HLA-A serotype group (HLA-A2) and ESO double positive tumors, anti-ESO mTCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of Interferons (IFN)- \\>= with high specificity.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\n\\- To determine whether the administration of anti-ESO mTCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) plus high-dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen may result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancers including melanoma expressing the ESO antigen.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 15 years and less than or equal to 70 years. Patients aged 15-17 years must weigh at least 50 kg.\n* HLA-A\\*0201 positive\n* Metastatic cancer including melanoma whose tumors express the ESO antigen\n* Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred after receiving standard care for metastatic disease\n* No contraindications for high-dose aldesleukin administration\n\nDesign:\n\n* Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) and aldesleukin to stimulate T-cell growth.\n* Transduction is initiated by exposure of cells to retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-ESO mTCR genes. This mTCR targets the exact same epitope as the human T-cell receptor (hTCR).\n* All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n* On day 0 patients will receive anti-ESO mTCR gene-transduced PBMC and then begin high dose aldesleukin.\n* A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) following the administration of the cell product.\n* The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design (Simon R, Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10, 1989). The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-ESO TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).\n* A total of up to 43 patients may be enrolled (41, plus allowing for up to 2 non-evaluable patients)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Melanoma","Meningioma","Breast Cancer","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Hepatocellular Cancer"],"keywords":["Metastatic Cancer","Gene Therapy","Immunotherapy","Tumor Regression","Melanoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":11,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1/Cyclophosphamide & Fludarabine + Anti-ESO murine TCR transduced PBL + HD Aldesleukin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine + anti-ESO murine T-cell receptor (TCR) transduced PBL + high-dose (HD) aldesleukin","interventionNames":["Biological: Anti-NY ESO-1 mTCR PBL","Drug: Cyclophosphamide","Drug: Fludarabine","Drug: Aldesleukin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Anti-NY ESO-1 mTCR PBL","description":"Day 0: Cells will be infused intravenously (IV) on the Patient Care Unit over 20-30 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["1/Cyclophosphamide & Fludarabine + Anti-ESO murine TCR transduced PBL + HD Aldesleukin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cyclophosphamide","description":"Days -7 and -6: Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day X 2 days intravenously (IV) in 250 mL dextrose 5% in water (D5W) infused simultaneously with mesna 15 mg/kg/day over 1 hour x 2 days.","armGroupLabels":["1/Cyclophosphamide & Fludarabine + Anti-ESO murine TCR transduced PBL + HD Aldesleukin"],"otherNames":["Cytoxan"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fludarabine","description":"Days -7 to -3: Fludarabine 25 mg /m\\^2/day intravenous piggy back (IVPB) daily over 30 minutes for 5 days.","armGroupLabels":["1/Cyclophosphamide & Fludarabine + Anti-ESO murine TCR transduced PBL + HD Aldesleukin"],"otherNames":["Fludara"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aldesleukin","description":"Aldesleukin 720,000 IU/kg intravenously (IV) (based on total body weight) over 15 minutes every 8 hours beginning within 24 hours of cell infusion and continuing for up to 5 days (maximum 15 doses).","armGroupLabels":["1/Cyclophosphamide & Fludarabine + Anti-ESO murine TCR transduced PBL + HD Aldesleukin"],"otherNames":["Proleukin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Response","description":"Percentage of patients who have a clinical response (complete response or partial response) to treatment (objective tumor regression).
