Data obtained in this study will provide valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting. Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response and toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive anti-PD-1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.\n\nIn addition, an amendment to this study allows evaluation of the combination of nivolumab and the anti-CTLA4 antibody, ipilimumab in the neoadjuvant setting for the treatment of resectable NSCLC. In a large, multicohort, phase 1 trial, the ORR to combination ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy in patients unselected by PD-L1 status ranged from 39-47%. Incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity ranged from 33-37% across the combination ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts which compares favorably with the rates of toxicity due to platinum doublet chemotherapy in this disease setting.\n\nThe current amendment includes addition of a third arm (Arm C) combining nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm B- Nivolumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Nivolumab administration:\n\nThree doses of nivolumab will be administered to enrolled patients on Day -42, Day -28, and Day-14 (+/- two days) prior to planned surgery on Day 0 or up to +10 days.","interventionNames":["Drug: Nivolumab"]},{"label":"Arm C- Nivolumab, Carboplatin, & Paclitaxel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Nivolumab 360 mg IV, Carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 IV, and Paclitaxel 175 or 200 mg/m2 IV every 21 days for 3 cycles prior to planned surgery on Day 0.","interventionNames":["Drug: Nivolumab","Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel"]},{"label":"Arm A- Nivolumab and Ipilimumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"One dose of Nivolumab 3mg/kg IV \\& Ipilimumab 1mg/kg will be administered to enrolled patients on Day-42, then 2 doses of Nivolumab 3mg/kg will be administered to enrolled patients on Day-28 and Day-14","interventionNames":["Drug: Nivolumab","Drug: Ipilimumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Nivolumab","description":"Anti-PD-1 Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Arm A- Nivolumab and Ipilimumab","Arm B- Nivolumab","Arm C- Nivolumab, Carboplatin, & Paclitaxel"],"otherNames":["BMS-936558 or MDX1106"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"Anti-PD-1 Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Arm C- Nivolumab, Carboplatin, & Paclitaxel"],"otherNames":["Paraplatin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Paclitaxel","description":"Anti-PD-1 Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Arm C- Nivolumab, Carboplatin, & Paclitaxel"],"otherNames":["Taxol","Onxal"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ipilimumab","description":"Anti-PD-1 Therapy","armGroupLabels":["Arm A- Nivolumab and Ipilimumab"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Safety as Measured by Number of Participants With Grade 3 and 4 Lab Abnormalities, as Defined by CTCAE v4.03","description":"Safety will be measured by drawing safety labs.
