Patients may have or not have received prior lines of antineoplastic therapy. An adaptive Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) employing the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle will be used during the dose escalation part for dose level selection and MTD recommendation. The primary objective of the Phase II part is to estimate antitumor activity of EGF816 as measured by overall response rate (ORR) determined by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) assessment in accordance to RECIST 1.1.","detailedDescription":"Following completion of screening procedures and confirmation of patient eligibility, the participants are enrolled in the study. The study treatment begin on Cycle 1, Day 1 with the first administration of EGF816. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days.
