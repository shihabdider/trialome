It is expected that of approximately 1200 (85 percent) subjects who will be included, about 1000 will be Caucasian; about 120 Asian, and the remainder (about 80) will be of other ethnic origin (that is neither Caucasian nor Asian). Approximately 480 (40 percent) subjects are expected to be free of progression at the end of combination treatment with cetuximab and platinum-based chemotherapy. These subjects will be eligible for randomization to intravenous cetuximab maintenance therapy with either 500 milligram per square meter (mg/m\\^2) every 2 weeks or 250 mg/m\\^2 weekly (q1w); about 240 subjects are expected per group.\n\nThe trial will be performed in a community practice setting, with approximately 230 centers participating in the trial worldwide (planned countries are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom and Venezuela). With noncompetitive enrollment, approximately 4 to 8 subjects are expected to be enrolled at each center. Enrollment in the individual centers is generally limited to a maximum of 8 subjects. If any of these subjects does not receive trial treatment for any reason or discontinue all trial treatment at the first visit, additional subjects may be enrolled until 8 subjects were treated. The primary endpoint of the trial will be overall survival time from inclusion into the trial to death. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints will be time to treatment failure, tumor response, and disease control rate. Other endpoints will include safety and toxicity, compliance with maintenance therapy, subject satisfaction and translational research (TR) (for subjects with tumor samples available)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":583,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cetuximab 250 mg/m^2 q1w + Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Cetuximab plus Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy"]},{"label":"Cetuximab 500 mg/m^2 every 2 weeks","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Cetuximab 500 mg/m^2"]},{"label":"Cetuximab 250 mg/m^2 weekly","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Cetuximab 250 mg/m^2"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cetuximab plus Platinum-based Doublet Chemotherapy","description":"Single first dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m\\^2 infusion will be administered intravenously over 120 minutes (min) followed by cetuximab 250 mg/m\\^2 intravenous infusion over 60 min q1w with background platinum-based doublet chemotherapy up to maximum of 6 cycles, until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.
