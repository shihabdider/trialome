Participants had histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that was not eligible for curative surgical resection and/or definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Alternatively, participants had metastatic non-squamous or squamous NSCLC.\n2. Participants had not received any prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, including but not limited to chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Those who had previously received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for non-metastatic disease, were required to have experienced a disease-free interval of at least 6 months from the last dose of chemotherapy and/or concurrent radiotherapy prior to randomization.\n3. Archival tumor tissue or a fresh biopsy (if archival tissue was unavailable) was required for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) level assessment and retrospective biomarker analyses. Only participants with evaluable PD-L1 results were considered eligible.\n4. Participants were required to have had at least one measurable lesion as assessed by the investigator in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.\n5. Participants had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participants were excluded if they had known mutations in any of the following genes:\n\n   * Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR): For participants with non-squamous NSCLC and unknown EGFR mutation status, tissue-based EGFR testing (performed either locally or at a central laboratory) or an endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)-based EGFR test was required prior to enrollment. Those found to harbor EGFR-sensitizing mutations were excluded.\n   * Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene.\n   * B-Raf Proto-Oncogene (BRAF) V600E mutation.\n   * ROS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ROS1) rearrangement.\n2. Participants who had received prior treatment with EGFR inhibitors, ALK inhibitors, or other targeted therapies for known driver mutations.\n3. Participants who had received any prior therapies targeting T-cell costimulatory or checkpoint pathways (e.g., programmed cell death protein 1 \\[PD-1\\], programmed death-ligand 1 \\[PD-L1\\], or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 \\[CTLA-4\\]) for metastatic NSCLC were excluded.\n4. Participants who had any condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids at a dose greater than 10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) daily, or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to randomization.\n5. Participants who had an active infection, including but not limited to tuberculosis, requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral treatment within 14 days prior to randomization were
