Chemoradiation may have been given either given concurrently or sequentially. Patients whose disease has not progressed following chemoradiation will be randomised within 6 weeks of completion of chemoradiation to receive osimertinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, and treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other discontinuation criteria are met. After progression, patients can be unblinded and may receive open-label osimertinib. After the final OS analysis, the study blind will be broken and patients still receiving open-label osimertinib will be supplied with open-label osimertinib by AstraZeneca for as long as their treating physician considers they are deriving clinical benefit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage III)"],"keywords":["Phase III","Osimertinib","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (Stage III)","Unresectable NSCLC","EGFR","chemoradiation therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":216,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Osimertinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Osimertinib (80mg or 40mg orally, once daily), in accordance with the randomization schedule.","interventionNames":["Drug: Osimertinib 80mg/40mg"]},{"label":"Placebo Osimertinib","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Matching placebo for Osimertinib (80mg or 40mg orally, once daily), in accordance with the randomization schedule","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo Osimertinib 80mg/40mg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Osimertinib 80mg/40mg","description":"The initial dose of Osimertinib 80mg once daily can be reduced to 40mg once daily.
