If documentation of ALK rearrangement as described above was not locally available, a test to confirm ALK rearrangement was performed by a Novartis designated central laboratory. Patients waited for the central laboratory result of the ALK rearrangement status before initiating treatment with ceritinib.","detailedDescription":"Approximately 160 patients diagnosed with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC (according to the 7th edition of the AJCC \\[American Joint Committee on Cancer\\] Cancer Staging Manual) and active lesions in the brain and/or diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis were included in the study, approximately 40 patients in Arm 1 and Arm 2, approximately 30 patients in Arms 3 and Arm 4, and approximately 20 patients in Arm 5. Additional patients were enrolled in Arm 4 to achieve approximately 60 patients in Arms 3 and 4 together (i.e. ALKi naïve patients), if enrollment rate in Arm 3 was slow.\n\n* Arm 1 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain and with prior exposure to an ALKi.\n* Arm 2 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain but with prior exposure to an ALKi.\n* Arm 3 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously treated with radiation to the brain but with no prior exposure to an ALKi.\n* Arm 4 included patients with metastases in the brain without evidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, previously untreated with radiation to the brain and with no prior exposure to an ALKi\n* Arm 5 included any patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis with or without evidence of active lesion at the baseline Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI.\n\nNote: Previous treatment with ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib was not allowed in Arms 1, 2, and 5.\n\nCeritinib was administered orally once daily at a dose of 750 mg (five 150 mg capsules) on a continuous dosing schedule. The treatment period started on Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\nComplete tumor assessments including gadolinium enhanced brain MRI was repeated at Week 8 (on Cycle 3 Day 1) and every 8 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles) thereafter or earlier if clinically indicated. Safety evaluations included (S)AEs, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, laboratory parameters and WHO performance status.

Patients with any grade of alopecia were allowed to enter the study.\n* Patient had life expectancy ≥ 6 weeks.\n* Patient had a WHO performance status 0-2.\n\nPatients in Arm 1 to 4 had to also meet the following inclusion criteria:\n\n\\- Patients had to have active brain metastases from NSCLC, confirmed by Gadolinium-enhanced MRI without concomitant leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Dose of steroids had to be stable for 5 days before the baseline brain MRI.\n\nPatients in Arm 5 had to also meet the following inclusion criteria:\n\n\\- Patients must have been diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who needed whole brain radiation to control the brain metastases. Patients were not eligible unless treated brain lesions were progressive or new brain lesions were observed since the post whole brain radiation therapy MRI.\n* Planning of any brain local treatment (including but not limited to surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiation, intrathecal chemotherapy) following the administration of the first dose of study drug.\n* Patient with a concurrent malignancy or history of a malignant disease other than NSCLC that had been diagnosed and/or required therapy within the past 3 years. Exceptions to this exclusion included the following: completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.\n* Patient had impairment of GI function or GI disease that could significantly alter the absorption of ceritinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or malabsorption syndrome).\n* Patient was receiving unstable or increasing doses of corticosteroids.\n* Patient had other severe, acute, or chronic medical conditions including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or psychiatric conditions or laboratory abnormalities that in the opinion of the investigator could increase the risk associated with study participation, or that could interfere with the interpretation of study results.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Novartis
