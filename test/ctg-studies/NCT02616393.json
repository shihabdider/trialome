Tumor response, both in the central nervous system (CNS) and outside the central nervous system (non-CNS), was assessed after the second cycle of treatment and then at the end of every two cycles of treatment thereafter. Subjects were treated with tesevatinib 300 mg QD until disease progression or the subject experienced unacceptable toxicity.\n\nSubjects who discontinued tesevatinib therapy were followed for survival.\n\nSubjects with NSCLC + EGFR mutations were assigned to one of three cohorts:\n\n* Cohort A: Brain Metastases (BM). Subjects had progressed with BM.\n* Cohort B: Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM). Subjects had initially presented or progressed with LM.\n* Cohort C: Brain Metastases at Initial Presentation (BM-IP). Subjects had no prior systemic therapy.\n\nEach of the three cohorts was to have 20 subjects, for a total of 60 subjects. All three cohorts were enrolled simultaneously.\n\nThe primary objectives were to include:\n\n* Clinical activity of tesevatinib of subjects in Cohort A (BM) and Cohort C (BM-IP) as measured by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 which evaluated changes in BM size.\n* Clinical activity of tesevatinib of subjects in Cohort B (LM) as measured by improvement in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 symptoms and signs.\n\nEfficacy assessments included response to treatment using RECIST criteria, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, laboratory testing, physical examination, vital signs, and pregnancy testing. In addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments were performed.\n\nAn End of Treatment Visit occurred within 3 days after the subject's last dose of study drug. This could have occurred at the visit when disease progression was diagnosed. Subjects were continued to be followed for disease progression and survival.\n\nA follow-up visit occurred 30 days (± 5 days) after the last dose of study drug. This visit may have occurred prior to 30 days if a new therapy was started within 30 days of last dose of study drug.\n\nFor long-term follow-up, after subjects withdrew from the active treatment portion of the study, they were contacted by telephone every 8 weeks to assess survival status and any subsequent anti-cancer treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Leptomeningeal Metastases","Brain Metastases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":36,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort A: Brain Metastases (BM)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tesevatinib 300 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) administered to subjects with NSCLC who had progressed with brain metastases (BM)","interventionNames":["Drug: Tesevatinib"]},{"label":"Cohort B: Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tesevatinib 300 mg PO QD administered to subjects with NSCLC who had progressed with leptomeningeal metastases (LM)","interventionNames":["Drug: Tesevatinib"]},{"label":"Cohort C: Brain Metastases at Initial Presentation (BM-IP)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Tesevatinib 300 mg PO QD administered NSCLC who presented initially with BM at initial presentation","interventionNames":["Drug: Tesevatinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Tesevatinib","armGroupLabels":["Cohort A: Brain Metastases (BM)","Cohort B: Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)","Cohort C: Brain Metastases at Initial Presentation (BM-IP)"],"otherNames":["KD019, XL647"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Best Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Subjects With BM","description":"The best overall response rates (ORRs) of subjects who had brain tumors and exhibited either a complete response (CR) or a partial responder (PR) to therapy divided by the total number of subjects treated with tesevatinib 300 mg PO QD.
