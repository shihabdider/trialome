Subjects will be evaluated every 9 weeks (63 ± 7 days) with radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment. QoL and Self-reported Health Questionnaires, as well as geriatric follow-up will be performed at the same intervals. Investigators will make all treatment-based decisions using immune-related Response Criteria (irRC). However, for determination of overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS), the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 will be used. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and graded in severity according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Treatment with MK-3475 will continue until two years of therapy have been administered, documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.\n\nAfter the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for a minimum of 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for up to 90 days after the end of treatment unless the subject starts a new anticancer therapy between days 31 and 90). Subjects will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status, including initiating a non-study cancer treatment and experiencing disease progression, until death, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.\n\nParticipation in this trial will be dependent upon supplying tumor tissue from a newly obtained formalin-fixed specimen from locations not radiated prior to biopsy. The specimen will be evaluated at a central laboratory facility for expression status of Programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) in a prospective manner. Only subjects whose tumors express Programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) as determined by the central laboratory facility will be eligible for inclusion in this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":83,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pembrolizumab Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"1 group, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 200 mg, every 3 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab","description":"Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 200 mg, every 3 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Pembrolizumab Arm"],"otherNames":["KEYTRUDA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"Defined as the length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of the treatment that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive.","timeFrame":"From the date of inclusion of the first patient to until end of follow up, up to 36 months."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes in Health-related Quality of Life With Lung Cancer Symptom Scale","description":"To evaluate changes in health-related quality of life in responder and non-responder patients older than 70 years with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
