The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was scored according to the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001). All EORTC scales and single-item measures are linearly transformed so that each score has a range of 0-100. A high score for a functional/global health status scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning/HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life); however, a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A≥10-point change in the symptoms subscale score was perceived by participants as clinically significant (Osoba et al. 1998). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement and negative change from baseline indicated worsening.","populationDescription":"ITT Population included all randomized participants irrespective of whether the assigned treatment was actually received.
