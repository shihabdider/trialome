Participants with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer will be required to consent to 2 mandatory tumour biopsies to be considered for enrolment in this study. The first biopsy will be done prior to initiating treatment with osimertinib and the second biopsy will be obtained any time between Investigator assessed, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)-defined progression and before the start of any new anticancer treatment. A third optional biopsy may be taken during the course of treatment at the Investigator's discretion if the patient consents and if clinically feasible. Tumour tissue and plasma samples will be collected and examined for genetic and non genetic aberrations that may be important in determining response and resistance to the treatment that participants will receive as a part of their cancer care. Patients should continue on osimertinib until progression or until other treatment discontinuation criteria are met. However, if patients continue to show clinical benefit to treatment as judged by the Investigator, patients may continue to receive osimertinib beyond RECIST 1.1-defined progression. Therefore, there is no maximum duration of treatment. Tumour assessments will be performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks from study enrolment until 3.5 years, and then every 10 weeks until RECIST 1.1-defined. Patients will be followed up for a period of 28 days following discontinuation of osimertinib. Target patient population Male and female patients aged 18 years and over with locally advanced or metastatic pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy. Patients will have a tumour that harbours one of the EGFR mutations known to be associated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity, either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations (EGFR mutation status determined by a local laboratory). Patients must be EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment-naïve and eligible to receive first line treatment with osimertinib. Osimertinib is an oral, potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitizing and resistance mutations in non-small cell lung cancer with a significant selectivity margin over wild type EGFR. Osimertinib (80 mg orally, once daily) will be administered. Doses may be reduced to 40 mg if needed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["EGFR Mutation Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["EGFR, NSCLC, Lung Cancer, Biopsy, Molecular Profiling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":154,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Osimertinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"An oral, potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitizing and resistance mutations in non-small cell lung cancer","interventionNames":["Drug: Osimertinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Osimertinib","description":"Osimertinib is an oral, potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitizing and resistance mutations in non-small cell lung cancer with a significant selectivity margin over wild type EGFR.","armGroupLabels":["Osimertinib"],"otherNames":["TAGRISSO, AZD9291"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of Patients With a Given Tumour Genetic and Proteomic Marker at the Point of Disease Progression","description":"The frequency of genetic and proteomic markers at disease progression regardless of their prevalence was evaluated.","timeFrame":"Genetic and proteomic markers were assessed at baseline and progression (up to 5 years after baseline)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","description":"PFS is defined as the time from first dose of osimertinib until the date of Investigator assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1-defined progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression.","timeFrame":"From date of first dose until date of progression or death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), up to 5 years"},{"measure":"Objective Response Rate (ORR)","description":"ORR is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least one visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks later.","timeFrame":"From date of first dose until progression, or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, up to 5 years"},{"measure":"Duration of Response (DoR)","description":"Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of first documented response, (that is subsequently confirmed) until date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression, the end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the PFS endpoint.
