In arm E, treatment of dual-agent chemotherapy will be selected based on RRM1 and ERCC1 expression at the protein level. In arm C, treatment of dual-agent chemotherapy will be gemcitabine/carboplatin, i.e., standard of care.","detailedDescription":"Before each cycle, blood tests, vital signs, interim medical history, and a physical exam will be performed. Patients will be carefully checked so that immediate intervention can be initiated should an adverse event (i.e. hypersensitivity) occur.\n\nThe last treatment cycle according to the study will be cycle #6, or any earlier cycle. Certain tests will be done within 28 days after the last drug infusion. These include physical exam, vital signs, temperature, weight, adverse event evaluation, imaging studies, and blood work.\n\nThe study doctor will see the participants every 6 to 8 weeks for at least 12 months after they start treatment.
