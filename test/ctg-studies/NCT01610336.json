Dose escalation started with a dose of 100 mg/day to a maximum of 1200 mg/day, as capsule or tablet formulation. Successive cohorts of patients were to receive increasing doses of capmatinib in combination with a 250 mg once daily (qd) dose of gefitinib until the MTD/RP2D of capmatinib had been determined. The Phase II dose expansion part consisted of 400 mg capmatinib twice daily (bid), as either capsules or tablets, in combination with 250 mg gefitinib."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["EGFR","c-MET","Lung cancer","Gefitinib","Erlotinib","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)","lung adenocarcinoma","large-cell lung carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":161,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"INC280 100 mg Cap QD Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; QD=once daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 200 mg Cap QD Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; QD=once daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 400 mg Cap QD Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; QD=once daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 800 mg Cap QD Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; QD=once daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 200 mg Cap BID Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; BID=twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 400 mg Cap BID Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; BID=twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 600 mg Cap BID Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; BID=twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 200 mg Tab BID Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"tab=tablet; BID=twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 400 mg Tab BID Phase Ib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"tab=tablet; BID=twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 400 mg Cap BID Phase II","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cap=capsule; BID=twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]},{"label":"INC280 400 mg Tab BID Phase II","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"tab=tablet; BID=twice daily","interventionNames":["Drug: INC280","Drug: Gefitinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"INC280","description":"During Phase Ib, INC280 was taken at escalating doses.
