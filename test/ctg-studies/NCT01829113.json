Despite these advances, poor outcomes with advanced disease warrant exploration of novel drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Preclinical evidence in lung cancer models shows promising antitumor activity with OGX-427 in combination with platinum based therapy or pemetrexed. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II study, pemetrexed and carboplatin plus OGX-427 followed by maintenance pemetrexed and OGX-427 will be compared with pemetrexed and carboplatin plus placebo followed by maintenance pemetrexed and placebo in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Recurrent Lung Cancer","Stage IV Lung Cancer","OGX-427","Sarah Cannon Research Institute","SCRI","OncoGenex","NSCLC","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":155,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"OGX-427","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Three loading doses of OGX-427 at 600mg intravenously (IV) will be administered over 9 days.
