Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, docetaxel, and pemetrexed, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab with ipilimumab or chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer compared to chemotherapy alone.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the major pathologic response rate (MPRR) in patients treated with induction nivolumab, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Toxicity (assessed by the National Cancer Institute \\[NCI\\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] version 4).\n\nII. Peri-operative morbidity and mortality. III. CD8 positive (+) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in resected tumor tissues of patients treated with nivolumab alone and nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nIV. Quantification of CD8+ TILs will be assessed by counting the cells positive for staining with an anti-CD8 antibody by immunohistochemistry in five random square areas (1 mm\\^2 each) in both intratumoral and peritumoral compartments using the automated Aperio system.\n\nV. Response rates to induction treatment (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] version 1.1).\n\nVI. Recurrence-free survival. VII. Overall survival. VIII. To correlate major pathologic response with recurrence-free and overall survival.\n\nIX. Complete resection (R0) rate. X. Pathologic complete response (pCR) in resected tumor specimens. XI. To correlate response assessed by imaging studies with outcomes (both major pathologic response to treatment and long-term recurrence-free survival).\n\nXII. To correlate blood, tissue, and stool-based biomarkers with efficacy and toxicity.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To identify novel prognostic and predictive markers present at diagnosis. II. To determine modulation of markers by induction immunotherapy and/or immunotherapy plus platinum-based chemotherapy in order to inform future translational studies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to Arms A and B and enrolled in Arm C or D after completion of enrollment to Arms A and B.\n\nARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm A and receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 22, and 43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
