In these patients we will deliver a short-course radiation to a single systemic (non-CNS) site within 14 days of receiving the first dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This sequence allows radiation to release tumor antigens from immune inaccessible areas such as necrotic tumor or low perfusion to provide a robust anti-tumor immune response with immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess six-month progression free survival (PFS) compared to historical control.","detailedDescription":"Subjects with front-line or relapsed NSCLC or relapsed HNSCC who are intended to receive standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors without a contraindication to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to a single cancer deposit greater than 1 cm (metastasis or primary cancer) will be enrolled. Subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) immune checkpoint inhibitors and within 2 weeks of initiation, and will receive either:\n\n* SBRT to target to achieve Biological Equivalent Dose (BED) \\> 100 Gy OR\n* 30 Gy fractionated radiation therapy (RT) delivered as a 3 dimensional (3-D) dose.\n\nThe lesion choice will be made by the treating radiation oncologist and will be directed to a single malignant focus (non-CNS) that measures ≥ 1 cm. Essentially, the goals of both techniques are the same but SBRT is reserved for lesions that are readily encompassed by a single field with large RT fractions in which dose-limiting organs are within safe limits."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor + Radiation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Immune checkpoint inhibitor (Nivolumab OR Pembrolizumab OR Atezolizumab) PLUS Radiation Therapy (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy OR fractionated radiation therapy)","interventionNames":["Drug: Immune checkpoint inhibitor","Radiation: Radiation Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Immune checkpoint inhibitor","description":"Standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor + Radiation"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Radiation Therapy","description":"Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy OR Fractionated radiation therapy","armGroupLabels":["Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor + Radiation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of Participants Alive and Without Progression","description":"Progression-free survival will be calculated as a rate, time from enrollment in the study to progression at 6-months post enrollment.","timeFrame":"6-months post enrollment"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of (Programmed Death) PD-1+ CD4+ T (Helper) Cells and PD-1+ CD8+ T (Cytotoxic) Cells Prior to Treatment Versus With Concurrent Treatment.","timeFrame":"Assessed at specified points--1) prior to each cycle of therapy for 4 cycles (one cycle equals 6 weeks) 2) at disease progression (date first progression post-randomization, assessed up to 3 years) 3) when participant is off-study, assessed up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Percentage of CD8+ T-cells That Are Gamma-interferon Positive During Treatment.","timeFrame":"Assessed at specified points--1) prior to each cycle of therapy for 4 cycles (one cycle equals 6 weeks) 2) at disease progression (date first progression post-randomization, assessed up to 3 years) 3) when participant is off-study, assessed up to 3 years"},{"measure":"Percentage PD-L1+ CD4+ and PD-L1+ CD8+ T-cell Expression Differences During Treatment","timeFrame":"Assessed at specified points--1) prior to each cycle of therapy for 4 cycles (one cycle equals 6 weeks) 2) at disease progression (date first progression post-randomization, assessed up to 3 years) 3) when participant is off-study, assessed up to 3 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
