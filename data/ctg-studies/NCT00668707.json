This study is designed to see if the daily ingestion of 20 milligrams of melatonin for one year can lower the incidence of developing lung cancer recurrence and/or death. Only patients with a diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer who are eligible for surgical resection can participate in the trial. The study will also be assessing for changes in quality of life, pain, fatigue, anxiety, sleep, and depression amongst the participants.","detailedDescription":"The trial employs a two-armed parallel placebo controlled trial design whereby patients with a diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer are randomized to receive either 20 mg of melatonin nightly or an identically matched placebo. All patients will be followed for two years with primary outcomes assessed at a two year time point and secondary outcomes evaluated throughout the course of the trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["melatonin","natural health product (NHP)","lung cancer","complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)","randomized clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":709,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Melatonin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"To receive 20 mg of melatonin nightly for 1 year post-surgery","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: melatonin"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"To receive 20 mg placebo nightly for 1 year post-surgery","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"melatonin","description":"20 mgs ingested nightly","armGroupLabels":["Melatonin"]},{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"placebo","description":"similar to experimental in all ways except for lack of active ingredient","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Lung Cancer Recurrence or Mortality - 2 Years","description":"Disease-Free survival (DFS) at 2 years post-surgery.
