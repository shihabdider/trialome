Eligible participants are to receive 4 to 6 cycles of a standard of care platinum-doublet chemotherapy regimen. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive denosumab or matching placebo with the first investigational product dose coinciding with participant's first cycle of chemotherapy and continuing until the primary analysis, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, or lost to follow-up. Participants who discontinued the investigational product early (ie, before primary analysis) were followed for disease status and survival. The primary analysis took place when 149 events of death had been reported.
