Furthermore, when the erlotinib-resistant model H1975 (LR858 and T790M mutation) was treated with BKM120, significant tumor control was observed (Novartis internal data). Therefore, combining BKM120 with erlotinib could potentially down-modulate PI3K-Akt activity resulting in a synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition and enhancing the response to erlotinib.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicentered, open-label, non-randomized Phase II study of BKM120 and erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC previously sensitive to erlotinib. After six patients are enrolled and complete one treatment cycle a safety analysis of adverse events (AEs) will be conducted to assure there are no unexpected or prohibitive toxicities of the combination. The planned study enrollment will continue to up to 37 patients. Duration of a patient's participation in the study will vary. Treatment will continue as long as the patient is benefitting from the treatment, has no evidence of disease progression, and does not meet any criteria for discontinuation or withdrawal."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Erlotinib","BKM120","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":37,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BKM120 and Erlotinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cycle 1: BKM120 80 mg PO daily; Erlotinib 100mg PO daily\n\nCycles 2 and beyond: BKM120 100 mg PO daily; Erlotinib 100mg PO daily","interventionNames":["Drug: BKM120 and Erlotinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"BKM120 and Erlotinib","description":"BKM120 and Erlotinib will be given once daily.
