Since the integrity of the data from these patients was seriously compromised, these patients were considered unevaluable for the protocol-specified analyses. These participants are referred to as the breached protocol cohort (BPC) and those still on study treatment at the time of the breach were offered the option of receiving open-label erlotinib for up to 2 years (including posttreatment and long-term follow-up assessments), not receiving open-label erlotinib but remaining in the study for posttreatment and long-term follow-up assessment, or withdrawing consent from treatment and further assessments. Participants who had discontinued study treatment prior to the breach were not offered open-label erlotinib and remained in long-term follow-up. Data from the BPC participants were analyzed separately and were not included in the assessments of primary or secondary endpoints in the randomized cohort and were not considered part of the primary analyses.The sample size for the randomized cohort was not changed due to the BPC and the data from RC and BPC were analyzed separately."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Adjuvant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Tarceva","Early-stage Lung Cancer","Adjuvant","RADIANT","NSCLC","EGFR-positive tumor","Stage IB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage II Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1252,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Erlotinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants received 150 mg/day erlotinib orally for 2 years or until relapse, death, participant request or investigator decision to discontinue study drug, or intolerable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants received matching placebo tablets orally for 2 years or until relapse, death, participant request or investigator decision to discontinue study drug, or intolerable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erlotinib","description":"150 mg tablet","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib"],"otherNames":["OSI-774","Tarceva"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo tablet","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Disease Free Survival (DFS)","description":"DFS is the time from the date of randomization until the first day non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relapse is documented by radiological exam and/or biopsy, or until death in the absence of relapse.
