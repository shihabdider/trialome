Participants in the platinum-based chemotherapy arms with non-squamous tumor histologies may receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy after the 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival (OS) compared to SOC chemotherapy.","detailedDescription":"Pembrolizumab-treated participants, who attain a confirmed complete response (CR) or who stop trial treatment after 35 administrations of study medication for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability, may consider stopping trial treatment. These participants may be eligible for re-treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy after they have experienced radiographic disease according to protocol-defined criteria. Response or progression in the Second Course Phase will not count towards the objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) endpoints in this trial.\n\nThe global study for MK-3475-042 enrolled 1274 participants.
