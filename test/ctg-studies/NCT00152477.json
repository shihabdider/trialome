The main aim of this part is to investigate safety and tolerability of carboplatin/paclitaxel plus CDP791.\n\nIf part one confirms that the combination of drugs is safe and well tolerated, 156 patients will enter part 2. They will be randomized to receive either carboplatin/paclitaxel (C/P) alone, or C/P plus one of 2 doses of CDP791. The main aim of this part of the study is to compare the anti-tumor effects of CDP791 plus C/T with those of C/T alone. Participants will receive up to six cycles of chemotherapy with or without CDP791. Those whose disease stabilizes, or responds, will be eligible to continue to receive CDP791. Participants in the C/T alone arm whose disease progresses will be eligible to receive CDP791 monotherapy.\n\nParticipants will be followed up longterm, so that survival can be measured."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carcinoma","Non-Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-small-cell-lung cancer","carboplatin","paclitaxel","VEGF","monoclonal antibody"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":165,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carboplatin/Paclitaxel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.","interventionNames":["Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel"]},{"label":"Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/CDP791 10mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Carboplatin and paclitaxel plus CDP791 10mg/kg","interventionNames":["Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel","Drug: CDP791 10mg/kg","Drug: CDP791 20mg/kg"]},{"label":"Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/CDP791 20mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Carboplatin and paclitaxel plus CDP791 20mg/kg","interventionNames":["Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel","Drug: CDP791 10mg/kg","Drug: CDP791 20mg/kg"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"10mg/mL vial AUC6.
