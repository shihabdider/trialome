The investigators propose that patients who are molecularly selected for treatment with nintedanib based on the presence of mutations in the following genes: VEGFR1-3, PDGFR-A, PDGFR-B, FGFR1-3, and TP53, will have clinically meaningful benefit in terms of response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS).
