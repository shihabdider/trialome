To determine toxicity profile of the combination of osimertinib (AZD9291) and telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl in patients with metastatic EGFR activating mutation positive NSCLC.\n\nII. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl and osimertinib (AZD9291) in patients with metastatic EGFR activating mutation positive NSCLC.\n\nEXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of osimertinib (AZD9291) and telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC who have developed progressive disease (PD) on front-line EGFR inhibitor therapy.\n\nII. To determine the overall survival (OS) of osimertinib (AZD9291) and telaglenastat (CB-839) HCl in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC who have developed PD on front-line EGFR inhibitor therapy.\n\nIII. To assess cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) and measure changes with response to treatment as well as disease progression (EGFR sensitizing mutations, T790M resistance mutation, recognized bypass mechanisms).\n\nIV.
