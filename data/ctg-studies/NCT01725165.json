Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving surgery and/or radiation therapy may be more effective than standard therapy and/or clinical observation in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine whether oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with no disease progression after first line therapy have prolonged progression free survival (PFS) when treated with local consolidation therapy (LCT) of residual disease (radiation or surgery) followed by maintenance or surveillance as per physician choice compared with no LCT.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the overall survival. II. Safety/tolerability of LCT. III. Time to progression of prior metastatic lesions. IV. Time to appearance of new metastases (central nervous system \\[CNS\\] vs. extra-CNS, treated lesion vs. new site).\n\nV. Quality of life (QOL).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I (IMMEDIATE LCT): Patients undergo ablation of all residual local and metastatic sites of disease by surgery and/or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). After completion of LCT, patients undergo either surveillance or maintenance treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nARM II (DELAYED/NO LCT): Patients undergo standard maintenance therapy or clinical observation, based on physician choice. Patients may cross-over to Arm I due to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) progression or toxicity at the treating physician's discretion.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 9 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer AJCC v7"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":85,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm I (immediate LCT)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo ablation of all residual local and metastatic sites of disease by surgery and/or EBRT.
