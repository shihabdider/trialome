Patients with known EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase (TK) activating mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements are not eligible for the study (prospective testing is not planned within this study). The Standard of Care options are: an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib \\[TARCEVA®\\]), gemcitabine or vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®)","detailedDescription":"The study has an umbrella design with 2 sub-studies: sub-study A (randomizing patients with PD-L1 positive tumours 1:1 into MEDI4736 (durvalumab) vs. Standard of Care) and sub-study B (randomizing patients with PD-L1 negative tumours 2:3:1:2 into MEDI4736 (durvalumab) vs. MEDI4736 (durvalumab) plus tremelimumab vs. tremelimumab vs. Standard of Care. The two substudies may have different durations of recruitment periods due to differences in patient population (PD-L1 expression). They may not run concurrently with start and completion of recruitment potentially occurring at different time points."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":597,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MEDI4736 (durvalumab) monotherapy in Sub-study A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"MEDI4736 (durvalumab) by intravenous infusion.
