Eligible subjects could be randomized to four (4) cycles of chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy, or immunotherapy followed by chemotherapy, or four cycles of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy.","detailedDescription":"This open-label, three-arm, non-comparative randomized phase II study is designed to evaluate three different sequences of double-consolidation with the humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against cell surface receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), pembrolizumab, and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced Non small cell lung cancer post induction chemotherapy. While the goal of each arm is to guarantee exposure to each of these two agents to patients who have not progressed post induction chemotherapy, they do so with different sequence. In ARMs A and B, consolidation is sequential, with either pembrolizumab followed by nab-paclitaxel (ARM A), or nab-paclitaxel followed by pembrolizumab (ARM B). In ARM C, consolidation is concurrent, with the two agents administered concurrently. As of July 24, ARMs B and C are closed, and no patients will be enrolled on this study. ARM A remains open to enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["lung cancer","PD-1 antibody","immune checkpoint blockade"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A: Sequential Consolidation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Completion of four cycles of Sequential Consolidation of Pembrolizumab 200mg every 21 days and then four cycles Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/mg2 on day 1 and day 8 every 21 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab"]},{"label":"Arm B: Sequential Consolidation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Completion of 4 cycles of Sequential Consolidation of Nab-paclitexel 100 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8 every 21 days and then Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 21","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab"]},{"label":"Arm C: Concurrent Consolidation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Concurrent Consolidation of Nab paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8 plus Pembrolizumab 200 m5 on day 1 every 21 days for four cycles","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab","description":"Receive Pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 every 21 days for four cycles.\n\nReceive nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8 every 21 days for four cycles.","armGroupLabels":["Arm A: Sequential Consolidation","Arm B: Sequential Consolidation","Arm C: Concurrent Consolidation"],"otherNames":["Keytruda","nab-paclitaxel"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"Overall survival is defined as the time from day 1 of treatment to death from any cause.
