This study will be conducted though the Sarah Cannon Research Consortium, a community-based clinical trial network.","detailedDescription":"Erlotinib is the current treatment standard for second- or third-line therapy of advanced NSCLC. Since angiogenesis inhibitors have also shown activity in NSCLC, the simultaneous inhibition of the EGFR and VEGF pathway may improve the efficacy of therapy. In a recently reported Phase III trial (Hainsworth et al. 2008), the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib improved the Progression- Free-Survival (PFS) vs. erlotinib alone when given as second-line therapy in NSCLC (3.4 months vs. 1.7 months, respectively; HR 0.63). Pazopanib also inhibits the angiogenesis pathway, and may have advantages over bevacizumab including: (1) inhibition of other potentially important targets, including PDGFR; and (2) more convenient oral administration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Lung Cancer","Previously Treated Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","Erlotinib","Pazopanib"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":202,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Erlotinib + Pazopanib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Erlotinib: 150 mg orally daily\n\nPazopanib: 600 mg orally daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Pazopanib","Drug: Erlotinib"]},{"label":"Erlotinib + Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Erlotinib: 150 mg orally daily\n\nPlacebo: orally daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pazopanib","description":"Pazopanib: 600 mg orally daily","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib + Pazopanib"],"otherNames":["Votrient"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erlotinib","description":"Erlotinib: 150 mg orally daily","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib + Pazopanib","Erlotinib + Placebo"],"otherNames":["Tarceva"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","description":"The length of time, in months, that patients were alive from first date of protocol treatment until worsening of disease.
