However, many benign conditions (such as atelectasis, consolidation, and radiation fibrosis) are difficult to differentiate from neoplasm on standard CT imaging, and FDG-PET/CT can be used to differentiate true malignancy in these settings. However, if FDG-PET/CT is to be used as a problem-solving tool in patients after RT, histopathologic confirmation of recurrent disease is needed because areas previously treated with RT can remain FDG avid for up to 2 years."
