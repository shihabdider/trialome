It comprises both multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (ie, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and treatment-related symptoms from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy (ie, hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia). Scores from 0 to 100 were derived for each symptom item, with higher scores representing greater level of symptoms.
