Determine the progression-free survival at 12 weeks in patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with dasatinib.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the rate of response in patients treated with this drug. II. Examine the relationship between clinical response to this drug and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status, EGFR copy number, and (phosphorylated Src) pSrc expression levels in pre-treatment tumor biopsies.\n\nIII. Determine the toxicity of this drug.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients received oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPreviously obtained paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for epidermal growth factor receptor and by immunohistochemistry for pSrc expression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm I","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients received oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21.
