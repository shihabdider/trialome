The safety of this combination treatment will also be studied.\n\nResearchers will also test the tissue from your earlier biopsy to measure the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The purpose of EGFR testing is to learn about any link between various forms of EGFR and your response to treatment with erlotinib.","detailedDescription":"Erlotinib is designed to block the activity of a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGFR). EGFR is found on the surface of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from growing.\n\nBefore you can start treatment on this study, you will have \"screening tests.\" These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You will have a FEV1 (breathing test). You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate). Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to check the status of the disease. You will be required to have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to locate the area of cancer outside the chest and lymph glands. You will have either a CT scan or an MRI to measure the size of the tumor(s). If there is positive finding of CT or MRI you will be taken off study. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). If you have a significant history of cardiovascular disease, you will have a MUGA scan and echocardiogram to test your heart function. Women who are able to have children must have a negative urine or blood (about 2 teaspoons) pregnancy test before starting treatment.\n\nYou will have PET scan 1 month after completion of consolidation chemotherapy.\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take erlotinib every day for 7 weeks (except on the days you receive chemotherapy). The erlotinib tablets should be taken at the same time each day, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, with a small glass (about 7 ounces) of water. If you are unable to swallow tablets, you may dissolve the tablets in distilled water to drink.\n\nYou will receive radiation every day (Monday through Friday) for 7 weeks. You will also receive chemotherapy through a needle in a vein once a week for 7 weeks. The chemotherapy will include carboplatin and paclitaxel. Receiving chemotherapy will take about 6 hours total.\n\nYou will receive consolidation therapy on weeks 11-17.\n\nTreatment on this study will last 17 weeks. Once a week during that time, you will have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests. You will also have a CT scan of the chest within about 4 weeks from beginning the study, 2 months after finishing therapy, and then every 6 months after that for 2 years. The CT scans are used to check the status of the disease.\n\nYou will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. In this case, you would not receive erlotinib anymore but would continue standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\nYou will be asked to come in to the clinic for follow-up visits to check on your recovery from treatment. The follow-up visits will be at the end of all treatment, 1 month after treatment, and then once a month for as long as your doctor feels it is necessary. Once your side effects have become less severe, you will be asked to come in to the clinic for follow-up visits every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months for the following 2 years after that. You will have a physical exam, and your medical history will be recorded. You will be asked about any side effects you may have. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will have a PET scan.\n\nYou have the right to leave the study at any time. If you choose to stop participating in this study, you should contact the study chair and/or research nurse. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if your medical condition gets worse and/or you are unable to comply with study requirements.\n\nAt the end of the study you will not be automatically notified of the research findings. If you wish to learn about the results, however, you may request them from the study chair.\n\nThis is an investigational study. All three study drugs are commercially available. Carboplatin, and paclitaxel are FDA approved for the treatment of NSCLC, but their use in combination with erlotinib is not. Erlotinib is FDA approved for some uses, but it has not been approved by the FDA to treat lung cancer patients like yourself who have not yet undergone chemotherapy; however, the FDA has permitted its use in this research study. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are considered standard of care treatment and you would probably be treated with these drugs or similar drugs even if you decided not to be in the study. Up to 48 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Lung Cancer","Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Adenocarcinoma","Bronchoalveolar Cell Carcinoma","Large Cell Anaplastic Carcinoma","Giant Cell Carcinoma","Clear Cell Carcinoma","Erlotinib","Erlotinib Hydrocholoride","OSI-774","Tarceva","Carboplatin","Paraplatin","Paclitaxel","Taxol","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Erlotinib + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Oral Erlotinib 150 mg daily + Paclitaxel 45 mg/m\\^2 by vein weekly + Carboplatin 2 AUC by vein weekly and Radiation Therapy 63 GY/35 fractions for 7 weeks cycles","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib","Drug: Carboplatin","Drug: Paclitaxel","Radiation: Radiation Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erlotinib","description":"150 mg by mouth daily for 7 Weeks","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["Tarceva","OSI-774","Erlotinib Hydrochloride"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"2 AUC by vein weekly for 7 Weeks","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["Paraplatin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Paclitaxel","description":"45 mg/m\\^2 by vein weekly for 7 Weeks","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["Taxol"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Radiation Therapy","description":"63 GY/35 fractions for 7 weeks (+/- 5 days)","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["RT","Radiotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Time To First Disease Progression","description":"Primary Endpoints is efficacy of concurrent erlotinib and chemoradiation as measured by time to progression.
