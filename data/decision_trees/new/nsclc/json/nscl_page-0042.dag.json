Combinations of tissue and plasma testing, either concurrently or in sequence are acceptable. Concurrent testing can improve time to test results and should be considered in the appropriate clinical situation. Negative results (meaning absence of definitive driver mutation) by one method suggests the use of a complementary method. Treatment is guided by available results and, if unknown, these patients are treated as though they do not have driver oncogenes."

Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-20 in either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. Broad molecular profiling is a key component of the improvement of care of patients with NSCLC.
