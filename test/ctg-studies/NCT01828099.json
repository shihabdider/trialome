The confirmation of ALK rearrangement was done using the ICH test by a Novartis designated central laboratory. Prior to the study, patients had not received any previous systemic, anti-cancer therapy, including ALK inhibitors, for newly diagnosed advanced non-squamous NSCLC.\n\nThe patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive ceritinib (750 mg once daily, fasted) or chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of a platinum-based doublet with pemetrexed followed by pemetrexed maintenance in patients without progressive disease after 4 cycles.\n\nTreatment was continued until the blinded independent review committee (BIRC) confirmed disease progression based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or meeting other discontinuation criteria. Patients in either arm were permitted to continue the assigned study treatment beyond BIRC-confirmed disease progression in case of continued clinical benefit, as determined by the Investigator.\n\nAll patients who discontinued treatment during the treatment phase for reasons other than death, lost to follow-up, pregnancy or disease progression entered the post-treatment follow-up period until disease progression, withdrawal of consent or death.\n\nIn the chemotherapy arm, patients were allowed to switch and receive ceritinib after BIRC-confirmed disease progression (extension-treatment period)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","NSCLC","ALK","LDK378","Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)","treatment of lung cancer after first metastasis","lung cancer","lung adenocarcinoma","Non small cell lung carcinoma","Non small cell lung cancer","non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":376,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ceritinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ceritinib administered continuously through oral dosing at a dosage of 750 mg once daily in fasted state.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ceritinib"]},{"label":"Chemotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pemetrexed plus cisplatin or carboplatin (based on Investigator's choice) for 4 cycles (Induction) followed by pemetrexed as single agent (Maintenance)","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Cisplatin","Drug: Carboplatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ceritinib","description":"Ceritinib was administered orally once-daily fasted at a dose of 750 mg capsules on a continuous dosing schedule.","armGroupLabels":["Ceritinib"],"otherNames":["LDK378"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed","description":"Pemetrexed was administered at a dose of 500 mg/m\\^2 as an intravenous (iv) infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cisplatin","description":"Cisplatin was administered by iv infusion at a dose of 75 mg/m\\^2 every 21 days for up to 4 cycles.","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"Carboplatin was administered as iv infusion (AUC 5-6) every 21 days up to 4 cycles","armGroupLabels":["Chemotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC)","description":"PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first radiologically documented disease progression (as assessed by BIRC per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause.
