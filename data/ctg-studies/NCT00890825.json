Amendment 4 of the CSP altered the primary objective and outcome variable from progression-free survival (PFS) to OS, and the secondary outcome variable changed from OS to PFS.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study were:\n\n* To further assess the efficacy of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone, in second-line patients with KRAS mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC\n* To assess the safety and tolerability profile of AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel\n* To investigate the use of plasma and serum as a potential source of circulating free tumour DNA (cfDNA) for the analysis of KRAS mutation status\n* To investigate the PK of AZD6244 and N-desmethyl AZD6244 and any other known metabolites when AZD6244 is administered in combination with docetaxel.\n\nThe exploratory objectives of the study were:\n\n* To assess the prevalence, severity and change over time of advanced NSCLC cancer specific symptoms in patients receiving AZD6244 in combination with docetaxel and docetaxel alone\n* To explore potential biomarkers in residual tumour, plasma and/or serum taken for KRAS mutational analysis which may influence development of NSCLC (and associated clinical characteristics) and/or response (optional)\n* To investigate the relationship between AZD6244 and/or N-desmethyl AZD6244 and any other known metabolite plasma concentrations or exposure and clinical outcomes, efficacy, AEs, and/or safety parameters if deemed appropriate\n* To collect and store deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), derived from a blood sample, for future exploratory research into genes that may influence response, eg, distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AZD6244 and/or agents used in combination and/or as comparators (optional)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)","KRAS mutation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":88,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AZD6244 + Docetaxel","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"AZD6244 75 mg bd + Docetaxel 75 mg/m\\^2","interventionNames":["Drug: AZD6244","Drug: docetaxel"]},{"label":"Placebo + Docetaxel","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo + Docetaxel 75 mg/m\\^2","interventionNames":["Drug: docetaxel","Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"AZD6244","description":"oral capsules, 75mg twice daily","armGroupLabels":["AZD6244 + Docetaxel"],"otherNames":["Selumetinib"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"docetaxel","description":"75mg/m2 iv on day 1 of every 21 day cycle","armGroupLabels":["AZD6244 + Docetaxel","Placebo + Docetaxel"],"otherNames":["Taxotere"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"placebo","armGroupLabels":["Placebo + Docetaxel"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"OS was calculated as the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of patient death (any cause).
