This study is a Phase 2 trial of MGCD265 in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has activating genetic changes of the MET gene (mutation or amplification \\[increase number of gene copies\\]). Testing for tumor gene changes can be performed in tumor tissue or blood samples. Patients must have previously received treatment with chemotherapy. The number of patients to be enrolled will depend on how many enrolled patients experience tumor size reduction. MGCD265 will be administered orally, twice daily. The study is designed to evaluate whether the number of patients experiencing tumor size reduction is substantially higher than would be expected with other available treatments.","detailedDescription":"If testing has not already been performed, the study will provide for the testing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Mirati","MGCD265","MET","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"MGCD265 in patients with MET activating mutations in tumor tissue","interventionNames":["Drug: MGCD265"]},{"label":"Arm 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"MGCD265 in patients with MET gene amplifications in tumor tissue","interventionNames":["Drug: MGCD265"]},{"label":"Arm 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"MGCD265 in patients with MET activating mutations in blood (circulating tumor DNA)","interventionNames":["Drug: MGCD265"]},{"label":"Arm 4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"MGCD265 in patients with MET gene amplifications in blood (circulating tumor DNA)","interventionNames":["Drug: MGCD265"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"MGCD265","description":"MGCD265 is a small molecule multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1","Arm 2","Arm 3","Arm 4"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective Response Rate","description":"Objective disease response is defined as the percent of patients documented by investigator assessment to have a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) for target and non-target lesions as assessed by CT or MRI.
