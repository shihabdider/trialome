Nivolumab is a human IgG monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and selectively blocks the interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby releasing PD-1 pathway mediated inhibition of the immune response, including anti-tumor immune response. RTKs have been implicated in mediating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which has emerged as a potential resistance mechanism to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Inhibition of these RTKs by sitravatinib may augment anti-tumor immune response and improve outcomes by overcoming resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Sitravatinib","Nivolumab","Docetaxel","Checkpoint inhibitor","MGCD516","NSCLC","SAPPHIRE"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":577,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Nivolumab and Sitravatinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Nivolumab will be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at 240 mg every 2 weeks or at 480 mg every 4 weeks.
