Has stage IIIB, IIIC, or stage IV NSCLC disease at the time of enrollment (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer, Eighth Edition).\n  2. Has one or more of the following documented activating genomic alterations: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, NTRK, BRAF, MET exon 14 skipping, or RET.\n\nKRAS mutations in the absence of any of the genomic alterations specified above will be excluded.\n\nOverexpression of EGFR, in the absence of activating mutations, is NOT sufficient for enrollment.\n\nParticipants who have not received osimertinib should be evaluated for the presence of EGFR T790M mutation after relapse/progression on/after the most recent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), unless the participant is already known to be positive with document results for this mutation or unless osimertinib is not locally approved.\n\n* Has documentation of radiographic disease progression while on or after receiving the most recent treatment regimen for advanced or metastatic NSCLC.\n* Participant must meet the following for advanced or metastatic NSCLC:\n\n  1. Has been treated with at least one but no more than two cytotoxic agent-containing therapy in the metastatic setting:\n\n     * One platinum-containing regimen (either as monotherapy or combination therapy).\n     * May have received up to one additional line of cytotoxic agent-containing therapy.\n     * Those who received a platinum-containing regimen as adjuvant therapy for early stage disease must have relapsed or progressed while on the treatment or within 6 months of the last dose OR received at least one additional course of platinum-containing therapy (which may or may not be same as in the adjuvant setting) for relapsed/progressive disease.\n  2.
