The main question it aimed to answer was as follows: Do patients who receive anamorelin HCl gain more body weight and show more improvement in anorexia symptoms than those who receive placebo.\n\nApproximately 316 patients were to be enrolled in the study. Of these patients, an equal number were to be assigned to each treatment group (anamorelin HCl or placebo). Participants were to take their assigned study drug by mouth once daily for a total of 24 weeks. During this treatment period, the patients were to visit the clinical study site every 3 weeks for health and other study-related assessments. Two weeks after the last treatment, patients were to receive a follow-up phone call.","detailedDescription":"The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anamorelin HCl. It was planned that approximately 316 patients with advanced NSCLC with cachexia were to be randomized 1:1 to anamorelin HCl 100 mg or placebo (158 patients per treatment group). The study treatment was to be taken orally once daily for a total of 24 weeks. Patients were instructed to take the study drug at least 1 hour before their first meal of the day.\n\nCentral randomization was stratified by line of systemic anti-cancer treatment (first line vs second line vs third line or higher), by type of anti-cancer therapy (immunotherapy vs non-immunotherapy), and by baseline score of 5 IASS (≤10 vs \\>10). Patients who had never received anti-cancer treatment prior to entering the study but who met all eligibility criteria were eligible to enter the study and were assigned to receive first line treatment in the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).\n\nPatients were to visit the site every 3 weeks for the study Treatment Period of 24 weeks. A follow-up telephone visit was to be scheduled at Week 26. Thus, patients were enrolled in the study for a maximum duration of 27 weeks (including a 1-week Screening Period, a 24-week Treatment Period, and a 2-week Follow-up Period). Each patient was scheduled to have a total of 10 planned visits plus 1 telephone contact for the Follow-up Visit."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cachexia; Cancer","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"This was a double-blind study.
