Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for their patients. One type of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).\n\nOsimertinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Unfortunately, despite the benefit observed for patients treated with osimertinib, the vast majority of cancers are expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining osimertinib with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer.\n\nIn total the study aims to enroll approximately 586 patients, consisting of approximately 30 patients who will participate in a safety run-in component of the trial, and approximately 556 who will receive osimertinib alone or osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the main trial. In the main part of the trial there is a one in two chance of receiving osimertinib alone, and the treatment is decided at random by a computer.\n\nThe study involves a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst receiving study medication, it is expected patients will attend, on average, approximately 15 visits over the first 12 months and then approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending on the arrangement of medical assessments by the study centre."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Locally","Advanced","Metastatic","Carcinoma","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Osimertinib","Tagrisso"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Parallel Assignment","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":587,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Osimertinib 80mg QD","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Osimertinib (AZD9291) 80mg QD.\n\nAll patients randomized into this will only receive Osimertinib 80mg.\n\nDose may be reduced to allow for the management of IP related toxicity.","interventionNames":["Drug: Osimertinib"]},{"label":"Osimertinib 80 mg QD and platinum-based chemotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Osimertinib 80 mg in combination with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC5) on Day 1 of 21day cycles (every 3 weeks) for 4 cycles, followed by Osimertinib daily with pemetrexed maintenance (500 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.\n\nDose may be reduced to allow for the management of IP related toxicity.","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed/Carboplatin","Drug: Pemetrexed/Cisplatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Osimertinib","description":"Drug: Osimertinib (Oral)\n\nOther Names:\n\nAZD9291","armGroupLabels":["Osimertinib 80mg QD"],"otherNames":["AZD9291"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed/Carboplatin","description":"Drug: Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus carboplatin (AUC5) on Day 1 of 21day cycles (every 3 weeks) for 4 cycles, followed by Osimertinib daily with pemetrexed maintenance (500 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Osimertinib 80 mg QD and platinum-based chemotherapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed/Cisplatin","description":"Drug: Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) on Day 1 of 21day cycles (every 3 weeks) for 4 cycles, followed by Osimertinib daily with pemetrexed maintenance (500 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Osimertinib 80 mg QD and platinum-based chemotherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Adverse Events Graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event v5 (Safety Run-In Treatment Arms Only)","description":"Adverse events were summarized by maximum reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) grade, version 5.0.\n\nGrade 1 (Mild): asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.\n\nGrade 2 (Moderate): minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.\n\nGrade 3 (Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening): hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.\n\nGrade 4 (Life-threatening consequences): urgent intervention indicated.\n\nGrade 5: Death related to AE.\n\nIncludes adverse events with onset date on or after the date of first dose and up to and including 28 days following discontinuation of treatment but prior to the start of a new anti-cancer therapy.","timeFrame":"From first dose date to 28 days following last dose, up to 45 months"},{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Randomized Component)","description":"Progression-free survival (PFS) using Investigator assessment as defined by RECIST 1.1.
