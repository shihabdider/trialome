Vaccines that are made from a gene-modified virus, such as TG4010, may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving TG4010 and nivolumab together may work better in previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab plus TG4010 (modified vaccinia virus Ankara \\[MVA\\]-human mucin 1 \\[MUC1\\]-interleukin-2 \\[IL2\\] vaccine) in previously treated patients with stage IV non squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with respect to objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nDefine the safety and toxicity profile of nivolumab plus TG4010 by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.\n\nDetermine progression-free survival by RECIST 1.1.\n\nDetermine overall survival.\n\nDetermine the duration of response and the occurrence of responses over time.\n\nDetermine the rate and duration of stable disease.\n\nDetermine the disease control rate."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment TG4010 + nivolumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive TG4010 SC once per week for courses 1-3 and every 2 weeks for courses thereafter and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks.
