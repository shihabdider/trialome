Another goal of this research study is to learn more about NSCLC and how it may respond to study treatment. Erlotinib (Tarceva) is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). TKIs block a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR may control tumor growth and tumor cell survival. However, although TKI drugs can work for some lung cancer patients for a period of time, eventually the tumor finds a way to resist or counteract the TKI treatment and it begins to grow again. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by the FDA for treating malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and several other diseases. Laboratory research suggests that when HCQ is given with a TKI, it may help delay or prevent TKI resistance from developing.","detailedDescription":"* Because no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will be randomized into of the study groups: Group A (erlotinib) or Group B (erlotinib and HCQ). Study treatment will be divided into time periods called cycles. Each study treatment cycle is 28 days.\n* Erlotinib (Group A and Group B) will be taken orally once a day. Hydroxychloroquine (Group B) will be taken orally once a day after taking erlotinib.\n* The following tests and procedures will be performed day 1 of each cycle: physical examination, performance status assessment, questions about any symptoms or side effects, blood for routine tests. The following procedures will be performed at certain study visits: Research blood tests (cycle 1, cycle 2, then every other even cycle); eye exam (cycle 4, cycle 7, and then every 3 months); assessment of the tumor with CT or MRI scan (done at the end of even cycles."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["NSCLC","HCQ","erlotinib","Tarceva"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Erlotinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Erlotinib 150 mg oral daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib"]},{"label":"Erlotinib and Hydroxychloroquine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Erlotinib 150 mg oral daily plus Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 1000 mg oral daily","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib","Drug: Hydroxychloroquine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erlotinib","description":"150 mg taken orally once daily","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib","Erlotinib and Hydroxychloroquine"],"otherNames":["Tarceva"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Hydroxychloroquine","description":"1000 mg taken orally once daily after erlotinib","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib and Hydroxychloroquine"],"otherNames":["HCQ"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Median Progression Free Survival","description":"A measure of progression-free survival in patients with advanced non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR mutations treated with erlotinib as compared with patients treated with erlotinib plus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
