Each item is answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).\n\nThe 12-items are summed together to obtain the domain score. Note that negatively phrased questions are reverse scored so that higher scores always represent improvement/less symptom burden. The total possible score for the A/CS domain ranges from 0 (worst) to 48 (best).","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","unitOfMeasure":"scores on a scale","timeFrame":"Change in FAACT A/CS Domain Score from baseline of the original trial through Week 12 of this extension trial","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Anamorelin HCl","description":"Active drug; 100 mg tablets; oral administration QD for 12 weeks, at least 1 hour before the first meal of the day."},{"id":"OG001","title":"Placebo","description":"Placebo tablets identical in appearance to active tablets; oral administration QD for 12 weeks, at least 1 hour before the first meal of the day."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"345"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"168"}]}],"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.46","spread":"0.92"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.24","spread":"1.01"}]}]}]}]},"adverseEventsModule":{"frequencyThreshold":"5","timeFrame":"Adverse events that occurred during the clinical trial, commenced with the first dose of study drug through the 28 day post-treatment follow-up visit.","description":"Adverse events that occurred following the signature of the informed consent, but prior to the first dose of study drug were not reported as adverse events in this trial.
