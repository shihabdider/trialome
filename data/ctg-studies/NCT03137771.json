Drugs used in maintenance chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, pemetrexed disodium, erlotinib hydrochloride, and gemcitabine work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Local consolidation therapy such as radiation/stereotactic body radiation or surgery may kill cancer cells left after initial treatment. Giving maintenance chemotherapy and local consolidation therapy together may work better than maintenance chemotherapy alone in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nPhase II\n\nTo evaluate the impact of adding local consolidative therapy (LCT) to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance systemic therapy alone on progression-free survival for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no evidence of progression and limited metastatic sites after first-line systemic therapy.\n\nPhase III\n\nTo evaluate the impact of adding LCT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance systemic therapy alone on overall survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC with no evidence of progression and limited metastatic sites after first-line systemic therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of adding LCT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance systemic therapy alone on in-field local failure.\n\nII.

Such designations would include but not be limited to treatments targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive NSCLC.\n* If a patient has progressed in previous areas of primary disease that received definitive doses of radiation, these patients would require re-irradiation in previous high dose anatomic areas and are not eligible for this study.\n* Patients with malignant pleural effusions that do not resolve after first-line systemic therapy; patients with pleural effusions that have become too small for thoracentesis at the time of registration would be permitted on study, indicating a significant response to first-line systemic therapy\n* Patients with more than 3 discrete locations of extra-cranial metastatic disease after first-line systemic therapy requiring more than 3 radiation/surgery plans to cover these distinct metastatic disease entities\n* Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of registration\n* Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during treatment and for 180 days after the completion of all treatment.
