carboplatin and paclitaxel or nano particle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) with or without pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) in adults with first line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nThe primary hypotheses are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs: 1) Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by a blinded central imaging vendor compared to placebo, and 2) Overall Survival (OS).\n\nAfter analysis of interim results was conducted, the protocol was amended (Amendment 5) to allow participants the option to discontinue placebo in the control arm and to switch to pembrolizumab in the event of documented progressive disease as assessed by central review."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD1, PD-1)","Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 1 (PDL1, PD-L1)","Programmed Cell Death 1
