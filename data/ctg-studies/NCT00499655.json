Celecoxib may also stop the growth of lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with celecoxib works compared with erlotinib hydrochloride alone in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving erlotinib + celecoxib vs. erlotinib + placebo for advanced NSCLC.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Objective tumor response rate as defined by RECIST Criteria for subjects receiving erlotinib/celecoxib treatment arms.\n\nII. Categorize the change in e-cadherin expression from baseline to week 8 in a subset of subjects.\n\nIII. Evaluation of overall survival (OS). IV. Measurement of COX-2, EGFR by immunohistochemistry and EGFR amplification by FISH, and EGFR mutation status to correlate with clinical response.\n\nV. Measurement of change in urinary PGE-M and correlation with response.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral placebo twice daily on days 1-28.\n\nARM II: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28.\n\nIn both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung
