If a genomic alteration is identified during profiling, it could help guide the choice of therapy and improve treatment outcomes. This study will examine the anti-tumor activity of selected commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed first-line treatment for one of the following tumor types: non-small cell lung cancers; urothelial cancer; non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and upper aerodigestive tract cancer.","detailedDescription":"This four-arm pilot phase II study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of selected commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed first line treatment for one of the following tumor types:\n\n1. non-small cell lung cancer,\n2. urothelial carcinoma,\n3. non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and\n4. upper aerodigestive tract cancers (lip, tongue, salivary glands, gum, mouth, oral cavity, tonsils, oropharynx, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, sinus, and larynx tumors).\n\nApproximately 160 patients (40 per tumour type) are planned for enrollment. Consideration for enrollment will be based on results from profiling with next-generation sequencing technology that was performed outside of the protocol. Eligible patients will receive one of the FDA-approved targeted agents at the recommended dose. The treating physician will decide which targeted agent to prescribe based on the genomic alterations per tumor type and the targets listed in the package insert for each agent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Urothelial Carcinoma","Gastrointestinal Carcinoma, Non-colon","Upper Aerodigestive Tract Carcinoma"],"keywords":["regorafenib","afatinib","targeted therapy","cabozantinib"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have failed first line treatment may receive either regorafenib (Stivarga), afatinib (Gilotrif), or cabozantinib (Cabometyx) at the recommended dose level, depending on their specific genomic alterations.","interventionNames":["Drug: Afatinib","Drug: Regorafenib","Drug: Cabozantinib"]},{"label":"Arm 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with urothelial carcinoma who have failed first line treatment may receive either regorafenib (Stivarga), afatinib (Gilotrif), or cabozantinib (Cabometyx) at the recommended dose level, depending on their specific genomic alterations.","interventionNames":["Drug: Afatinib","Drug: Regorafenib","Drug: Cabozantinib"]},{"label":"Arm 3","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with non-colon gastrointestinal cancers who have failed first line treatment may receive either regorafenib (Stivarga), afatinib (Gilotrif), or cabozantinib (Cabometyx) at the recommended dose level, depending on their specific genomic alterations.","interventionNames":["Drug: Afatinib","Drug: Regorafenib","Drug: Cabozantinib"]},{"label":"Arm 4","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancers who have failed first line treatment may receive either regorafenib (Stivarga), afatinib (Gilotrif), or cabozantinib (Cabometyx) at the recommended dose level, depending on their specific genomic alterations.","interventionNames":["Drug: Afatinib","Drug: Regorafenib","Drug: Cabozantinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Afatinib","description":"40 mg orally once daily for each 28-day cycle.
