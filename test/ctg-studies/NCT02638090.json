Researchers also want to find out if the combination of pembrolizumab and vorinostat is safe and tolerable. This study will compare the effects of the combination of two drugs called pembrolizumab and vorinostat with the effects of pembrolizumab alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab for use to treat a deadly skin cancer called melanoma and lung cancer and vorinostat to treat some forms of blood and lymph node cancers.","detailedDescription":"A Phase I/Randomized Phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab and vorinostat in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1 patients with immune therapy naïve and immune therapy pretreated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed through one prior line of therapy.\n\nThe begins with a phase I dose escalation utilizing the modified continuous reassessment method (O'Quigley, Pepe, \\& Fisher, 1990). This would be followed by a phase I expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in 18 NSCLC patients who have been previously treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. In parallel, a separate phase II arm will randomize 70 patients to a pembrolizumab alone group and a pembrolizumab plus vorinostat group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["advanced lung cancer","immune therapy naive","immune therapy pre-treated","NSCLC","Stage IV lung cancer","pembrolizumab","vorinostat","immunogenicity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Phase I Dose Escalation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Level 1: Vorinostat 200mg by mouth (PO) Daily; Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) every (Q) 3 weeks.\n\nLevel 2: Vorinostat 400 mg PO Daily; Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: Vorinostat","Drug: Pembrolizumab"]},{"label":"Phase Ib Expansion","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pembrolizumab plus Vorinostat.\n\nLevel 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)","interventionNames":["Drug: Vorinostat","Drug: Pembrolizumab"]},{"label":"Arm A: Pembrolizumab","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pembrolizumab treatment only.\n\nLevel 1: Pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3 wks","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab"]},{"label":"Arm B: Pembrolizumab plus Vorinostat","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pembrolizumab plus Vorinostat treatment.\n\nLevel 1: MTD","interventionNames":["Drug: Vorinostat","Drug: Pembrolizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vorinostat","description":"Administered per treatment arm guidelines.","armGroupLabels":["Arm B: Pembrolizumab plus Vorinostat","Phase I Dose Escalation","Phase Ib Expansion"],"otherNames":["Zolinza"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab","description":"Administered per treatment arm guidelines.","armGroupLabels":["Arm A: Pembrolizumab","Arm B: Pembrolizumab plus Vorinostat","Phase I Dose Escalation","Phase Ib Expansion"],"otherNames":["KEYTRUDA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)","description":"The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) corresponding to a risk of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring in 30% of patients.
