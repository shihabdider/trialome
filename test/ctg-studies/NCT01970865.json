Any pathological lymph nodes (recorded as target lesion) must have reduction in short axis to \\<10 mm.

with playing cards. In this task, the on-screen instructions ask: \"Is the previous card the same?\". A playing card is presented in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the previous card. If it is the same the participant should press \"Yes\", and if not press \"No\". The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded, mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is used to demonstrate speed of performance, and the arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses is used to demonstrate accuracy. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.","populationDescription":"PRO evaluable analysis set included all enrolled participants who received study treatment, had a baseline test assessment and at least 1 on-study test assessment.

uses a well validated list learning paradigm administered using a computer. High frequencies, high imagery, concrete nouns (items from a shopping list) were read to the participant at the rate of one word every 2 seconds. Once all 12 words had been read, the participant was asked to recall as many of the words as quickly as possible. The words recalled by the participant were marked on the computer screen. When the participant could recall no more words, the same list was read again. The words recalled by the participant were recorded. This was then repeated a third time. Total number of correct responses on 3 consecutive trials at a single assessment was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.","populationDescription":"PRO evaluable analysis set included all enrolled participants who received study treatment, had a baseline test assessment and at least 1 on-study test assessment.
