Planned sample size is N=30.\n\nInvestigational drug is Pembrolizumab at fixed dose, given 200 mg q3w i.v. for 2 cycles. After completion of immunotherapy lobectomy/ bilobectomy with curative intent is scheduled.\n\nPrimary objectives are to assess feasibility and safety of a neoadjuvant application of pembrolizumab and to assess antitumor activity of pembrolizumab with regard to clinical and pathologic tumor response. Secondary objective is to assess the impact of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab on patient disease free and overall survival. Exploratory objective is o explore potential predictive biomarkers for pembrolizumab efficacy (immune cell imaging)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pembrolizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pembrolizumab at fixed dose: 200 mg q3w i.v. for 2 cycles","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab","description":"Pembrolizumab at fixed dose: 200 mg q3w i.v. for 2 cycles","armGroupLabels":["Pembrolizumab"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Patients Treated in Compliance With Protocol","description":"The definition for this endpoint was neoadjuvant pembrolizumab treatment followed by successful curative intent tumor resection.","timeFrame":"From screening until surgery, ca. 6-8 weeks"},{"measure":"Tumor Response According to RECIST 1.1 Criteria","description":"Radiologic tumor assessments were performed at screening and pre-surgery.","timeFrame":"From screening until pre-surgery radiologic assessment, ca. 6-8 weeks"},{"measure":"Tumor Response Evaluation - Pathologic Response","description":"Pathologic regression grading according to Junker criteria.\n\nThe following grades are defined:\n\nGrade I No tumor regression or only spontaneous tumor regression in the sections of the primary tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\nGrade IIa Morphological signs of therapy-induced tumor regression in the sections of the primary tumor and/or mediastinal lymph nodes: More than 10% vital tumor tissue\n\nGrade IIb Morphological signs of therapy-induced tumor regression: Less than 10% vital tumor tissue\n\nGrade III Complete tumor regression, no evidence of vital tumor in the sections of the primary tumor and/or mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\nRegression grades IIb and III suggest a good response to neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nReference: Junker K, Langner K, Klinke F, Bosse U, Thomas M.
