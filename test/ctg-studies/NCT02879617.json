Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state, leading to some items being reverse-scored.","populationDescription":"Treated patients that completed FACT-L Lung cancer subscale (LCS) questionnaire","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","unitOfMeasure":"score on a scale","timeFrame":"At 12 months","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Durvalumab","description":"Durvalumab: 1500 mg administered intravenously (IV) on day 1 of every 28 day cycle"}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9"}]}],"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.9444","spread":"2.92024"}]}]}]}]},"adverseEventsModule":{"frequencyThreshold":"0","timeFrame":"Adverse Events data were collected for up to 33 months per patient, and up to","description":"Adverse Events were defined using National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE version 4.03","eventGroups":[{"id":"EG000","title":"Durvalumab","description":"Durvalumab: 1500 mg administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of every 28 day cycle","deathsNumAffected":40,"deathsNumAtRisk":47,"seriousNumAffected":26,"seriousNumAtRisk":47,"otherNumAffected":45,"otherNumAtRisk":47}],"seriousEvents":[{"term":"Anemia","organSystem":"Blood and lymphatic system disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":2,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Atrial fibrillation","organSystem":"Cardiac disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":4,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Cardiac arrest","organSystem":"Cardiac disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":2,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Pericardial effusion","organSystem":"Cardiac disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Colitis","organSystem":"Gastrointestinal disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage","organSystem":"Gastrointestinal disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Death NOS","organSystem":"General disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Fatigue","organSystem":"General disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Non-cardiac chest pain","organSystem":"General disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":2,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Pain","organSystem":"General disorders","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Lung infection","organSystem":"Infections and infestations","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":10,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Sepsis","organSystem":"Infections and infestations","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Urinary tract infection","organSystem":"Infections and infestations","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":2,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Fall","organSystem":"Injury, poisoning and procedural complications","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":2,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Fracture","organSystem":"Injury, poisoning and procedural complications","sourceVocabulary":"NCI CTCAE v4.03","assessmentType":"SYSTEMATIC_ASSESSMENT","stats":[{"groupId":"EG000","numAffected":1,"numAtRisk":47}]},{"term":"Injury, poisoning and procedural complications -
