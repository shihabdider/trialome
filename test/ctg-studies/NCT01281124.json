Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the ability of 5-azacytidine to cause DNA hypomethylation and re-expression of silenced tumor suppressor genes when stratified for high or low expression of mir29a, b, and c.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the molecular studies (mir29 expression and tumor suppressor gene methylation) between archival tissue, fresh biopsy pre-treatment samples, and post-treatment fresh samples.\n\nII. To determine the overall response rate by CT (RECIST 1.1 criteria) and PET (EORTC PET response criteria), PFS, and OS of patients treated with azacytidine in the second- or third-line setting.\n\nIII. To correlate the blood microRNA profiles (and changes in microRNA profiles) with response to azacytidine.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients undergo tissue and blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study treatment for correlative studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma","Stage IV Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (azacitidine)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-7.
