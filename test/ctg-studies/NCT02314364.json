Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. The investigational intervention in this study is SBRT with proton or photon radiation (explained below). \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied. SBRT and proton radiation therapy are FDA approved radiation delivery systems. However, using it as a treatment for stage IV NSCLC is still investigational.\n\nSBRT is a specialized, technologically advanced type of external beam radiation therapy that pinpoints high doses of radiation directly on the cancer. Because of high precision, these treatments spare healthy tissue and are associated with fewer side effects. SBRT is very different from conventional therapy where radiation is delivered in small doses given daily over the course of several weeks. For SBRT, the total dose of radiation is typically administered in 4-5 daily sessions. SBRT can be delivered with standard, so called photon radiation, or proton beam. Neither of these two types of radiation is generally superior over the other. There are technical differences between these two, and depending on tumor location, size, shape, and other factors, the investigators will decide which type of radiation to use for which treatment.\n\nAfter the screening procedures confirm you are eligible to participate in the research study:\n\n\\- Each participant will receive stereotactic treatment course (SBRT with protons or photons) to the area of their tumor."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic","Targetable Oncogenes (EGFR, ALK, ROS1)"],"keywords":["Non-small cell lung cancer","Metastatic","EGFR","ALK","ROS1","Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":27,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with protons or photons","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* SBRT dosage determined by treating physician\n* Patients will continue to receive standard of care (SOC) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in the intervals between SBRT courses, as well as after the completion of SBRT\n* If there is more than one active site of cancer, additional site(s) will be treated with stereotactic treatment courses.

The complete extent of the current residual systemic disease must be deemed amenable to SBRT as per review of imaging studies by a radiation oncologist, based on the following criteria:\n\n  * Lung: 1-3 lesions (including the primary) of maximum size 5 cm in longest diameter. A minimum size 1 cm in the longest diameter is recommended. (Patients with a malignant pleural effusion prior to the start of TKI therapy will be considered eligible for SBRT if there is complete radiographic resolution of the effusion while on systemic therapy);\n  * Spine: Bone lesions must be limited to the spine. A maximum of 2 spinal metastases will be considered for SBRT, with each site spanning 1-3 vertebral bodies. A minimum size of 1 cm in longest diameter is recommended. SBRT may target sclerotic lesions that persist following TKI therapy;\n  * GI: 1-4 liver metastases of maximum size 5 cm in longest diameter and/or 1-2 adrenal metastases of maximum 4 cm size in longest diameter. A minimum size of 1 cm in longest diameter is recommended.\n\nIn addition:\n\n* CNS: 1-4 brain metastases of maximum size 3cm in longest diameter. However, these should be treated with standard-of-care SRS and will not be defined as target lesions for purposes of this protocol.\n* A maximum number of 5 target lesions outside the brain, excluding the lung primary, is recommended to ensure that enrollment is limited to patients with low-burden disease and that treatments can be delivered within the specified time frame.\n\n  * History of prior radiation therapy to brain or skeleton is allowed, but should have occurred \\> 2 months from enrollment.\n  * Age at least 18 years.\n  * Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.\n  * ECOG performance status ≤ 2.\n  * Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks of registration for women of childbearing potential is required.\n  * Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Residual hilar or mediastinal lymph node disease (size \\> 1cm in short-axis diameter on CT). Non-malignant etiologies for enlarged lymph nodes may be evaluated per standard clinical practice.\n* Participants who have received prior radiation therapy to anatomical sites other than brain or skeleton.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients who are pacemaker or defibrillator-dependent as these devices may not be operated concurrently with delivery of proton beam radiation.\n* Pregnant or lactating women, as treatment involves unforeseeable risks to the embryo or fetus.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Henning Willers, MD","affiliation":"Massachusetts General Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Massachusetts General Hospital","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02114","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}}]}},"resultsSection":{"participantFlowModule":{"groups":[{"id":"FG000","title":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with protons or photons","description":"* SBRT dosage determined by treating physician\n* Patients will continue to receive standard of care (SOC) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in the intervals between SBRT courses, as well as after the completion of SBRT\n* If there is more than one active site of cancer, additional site(s) will be treated with stereotactic treatment courses.
