Erlotinib is a oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets EGFR. Sorafenib is a oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet derived growth factor receptor beta, Raf-1, Flt-3, and C-kit. These agents also do not exhibit overlapping adverse event profiles which provided additional support for studying this combination therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Advanced","Sorafenib","Erlotinib","Double-blind","Placebo-controlled"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":166,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Combination Therapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Erlotinib + Sorafenib","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib + Sorafenib"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Erlotinib + Placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib + Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erlotinib + Sorafenib","description":"Patients who are randomized to Cohort A will take sorafenib 400 mg (2 x 200-mg tablets) orally twice a day, and erlotinib 150 mg orally once a day.","armGroupLabels":["Combination Therapy"],"otherNames":["Tarceva","Nexavar"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erlotinib + Placebo","description":"Patients who are randomized to Cohort B will take erlotinib 150 mg orally once a day and placebo orally twice a day.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["Tarceva"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR)","description":"Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy.
