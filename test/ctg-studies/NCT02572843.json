The addition of immunotherapy with the anti-PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 as a novel treatment modality has the potential to improve the outcome without adding substantial toxicity to an otherwise intensive multimodality treatment, as MEDI4736 has been generally well tolerated. Based on the current evidence on immune checkpoint inhibition, there is a strong rationale to test this novel treatment modality also in the curative setting in order to improve local tumor control and prevent distant metastasis to improve the cure rate in this patient population.\n\nThe trial investigates the addition of pre- and post-operative immune checkpoint inhibition with MEDI4736 to the previously established standard of care for stage IIIA(N2) patients, which is based on the trials SAKK16/96 and SAKK16/00. Patients whose tumor is deemed resectable at diagnosis will receive 3 cycles (21 days each) of standard chemotherapy with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) / docetaxel (85 mg/m2), followed by 2 cycles (14 days each) of neoadjuvant immunotherapy with MEDI4736 750 mg. Following surgery, patients with complete resection (R0) of their tumor will be administered adjuvant treatment with MEDI4736 750 mg for up to one year or until recurrence, death, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal (whichever occurs first). Patients with incomplete R1/R2 resection, including patients with extracapsular spread of mediastinal lymph node metastases, may undergo standard radiotherapy prior to adjuvant treatment with MEDI4736."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NSCLC Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["NSCLC","lung cancer","MEDI4736","non-small cell lung cancer","immunotherapy","anti-PD-L1"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"MEDI4736","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients whose tumor is deemed resectable at diagnosis will receive 3 cycles (21 days each) of standard chemotherapy with cisplatin/docetaxel followed by 2 cycles (14 days each) of neoadjuvant immunotherapy with MEDI4736 750 mg.
