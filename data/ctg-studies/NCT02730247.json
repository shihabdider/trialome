If they join this study, they would receive ramucirumab (Cyramza ®) in combination with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®). Ramucirumab given with nab-paclitaxel is considered an investigational drug combination to use in this type of cancer because giving these two drugs together has not been approved by any regulatory authority like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NSCLC cancer. Ramucirumab works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells. Nab-Paclitaxel works by blocking the ability of cancer cells to break down the internal 'skeleton' that allows them to divide and multiply. With the skeleton still in place, the cells cannot divide and they eventually die.","detailedDescription":"Ramucirumab is a human IgG1 (Immunoglobulin G) monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor). A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel compared with docetaxel and placebo in patients with Stage IV squamous and non-squamous NSCLC in the 2nd-line treatment setting. This study demonstrated a superior overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR) with the combination therapy compared with docetaxel with placebo. This effect was seen across histologic subtypes, in the absence of excess toxicity in patients with squamous cell histology. This finding is intriguing, as prior study of bevacizumab in patients with NSCLC of squamous cell histology was associated with excess pulmonary hemorrhage. This provides the rationale for further investigation of ramucirumab in patients with squamous cell NSCLC.\n\nnab-Paclitaxel is a formulation of paclitaxel complexed with albumin that is readily soluble in saline and allows administration of paclitaxel without the use of lipid-based solvents and the need for corticosteroid and antihistamine premedication. nab-Paclitaxel was approved for the 1st line treatment of NSCLC based on a trial which demonstrated a superior ORR with the addition of nab-paclitaxel to carboplatin compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC, as well as prolonged PFS and OS without statistical significance. The subgroup analysis by tumor histology demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin in terms of best overall response rate (41% vs 24%, p\\<0.001), and numerically better PFS and OS in squamous NSCLC. \\[3\\]\n\nThis is a single-arm phase II clinical trial, in which patients with previously treated NSCLC will be treated with ramucirumab/nab-paclitaxel until disease progression, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity or withdrawal of consent with the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. A minimum of 40 patients with squamous cell histology will be required for determination of the co-primary endpoint. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of ramucirumab to nab-paclitaxel is well-tolerated and associated with a superior PFS compared with single agent taxane-based therapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["ramucirumab","docetaxel"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"ramucirumab + nab-paclitaxel","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Ramucirumab will be administered through a vein in the arm as a 60 minute infusion at a dose of 8 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.\n\nThe nab-paclitaxel will be administered through a vein in the arm as a 30 minute infusion at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle.","interventionNames":["Drug: ramucirumab","Drug: nab-paclitaxel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"ramucirumab","description":"it is administered through a vein in the arm as a 60 minute infusion at a dose of 8 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.","armGroupLabels":["ramucirumab + nab-paclitaxel"],"otherNames":["Cyramza"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"nab-paclitaxel","description":"it is administered through a vein in the arm as a 30 minute infusion at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle.","armGroupLabels":["ramucirumab + nab-paclitaxel"],"otherNames":["Abraxane"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS)","description":"The duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death.
