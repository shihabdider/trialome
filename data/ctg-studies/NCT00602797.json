Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine tartrate and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety and efficacy of a combination of vinorelbine and paclitaxel administered weekly to elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. To assess the response rate of a combination of vinorelbine and paclitaxel administered weekly to elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. III. To assess the quality of life of elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer during administration of weekly paclitaxel and vinorelbine. OUTLINE: Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate intravenously (IV) over 6-10 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 5 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (vinorelbine tartrate, paclitaxel)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate IV over 6-10 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Paclitaxel","Other: Quality-of-Life Assessment","Other: Questionnaire Administration","Drug: Vinorelbine Tartrate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Paclitaxel","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (vinorelbine tartrate, paclitaxel)"],"otherNames":["Anzatax","Asotax","Bristaxol","Praxel","Taxol","Taxol Konzentrat"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Quality-of-Life Assessment","description":"Ancillary studies","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (vinorelbine tartrate, paclitaxel)"],"otherNames":["Quality of Life Assessment"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Questionnaire Administration","description":"Ancillary studies","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (vinorelbine tartrate, paclitaxel)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vinorelbine Tartrate","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (vinorelbine tartrate, paclitaxel)"],"otherNames":["Biovelbin","Eunades","KW-2307","Navelbine","Navelbine Ditartrate","Vinorelbine Ditartrate"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-free Survival.","description":"Time from first therapy until first documentation of clinical progression, relapse or death.
