Abraxane is a chemotherapy approved to treat patients with breast cancer. Doctors want to know if Abraxane is safe and effective in treating patients with lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall response rate of weekly nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations following front-line therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile of weekly nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations following front-line therapy with an EGFR TKI.\n\nII. To evaluate the time-to-progression and overall survival.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":26,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formula)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
