Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving docetaxel together with bortezomib may kill more tumor cells","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare the efficacy and tolerability of sequential vs concurrent docetaxel and bortezomib in patients with previously treated, progressive or recurrent, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSECOND OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare time to progression in patients with previously treated NSCLC treated with these regimens.\n\nII. To compare 1-year and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.\n\nIII. To compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in the context of this study.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine levels of expression of molecular markers regulated by docetaxel and bortezomib and correlate with clinical response and overall survival of these patients.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1) and number of prior chemotherapy treatments (1 vs \\>1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 2 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":81,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8.","interventionNames":["Drug: docetaxel","Drug: bortezomib","Other: laboratory biomarker analysis","Other: immunoenzyme technique","Other: immunohistochemistry staining method","Other: pharmacological study"]},{"label":"Arm 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 2 and 8.","interventionNames":["Drug: docetaxel","Drug: bortezomib","Other: laboratory biomarker analysis","Other: immunoenzyme technique","Other: immunohistochemistry staining method","Other: pharmacological study"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"docetaxel","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1","Arm 2"],"otherNames":["RP 56976","Taxotere","TXT"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"bortezomib","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1","Arm 2"],"otherNames":["LDP 341","MLN341","VELCADE"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"laboratory biomarker analysis","description":"correlative study","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1","Arm 2"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"immunoenzyme technique","description":"correlative study","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1","Arm 2"],"otherNames":["immunoenzyme techniques"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"immunohistochemistry staining method","description":"correlative study","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1","Arm 2"],"otherNames":["immunohistochemistry"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"pharmacological study","description":"correlative study","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1","Arm 2"],"otherNames":["pharmacological studies"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Response Rate","description":"Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT, MRI or X-ray: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \\>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"Will be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier.","timeFrame":"From first day of treatment to time of death due to any cause, up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Disease Control Rate","description":"Disease control rate was defined as the rate of partial response (PR) plus stable disease (SD; for at least 2 cycles).","timeFrame":"Up to 4 years"},{"measure":"Progression-free Survival @ 6 Months","description":"Estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier.
