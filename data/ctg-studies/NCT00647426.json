Docetaxel and carboplatin will be given on day 1 of every three week cycle. Patients will take Sorafenib twice a day on the 1st day of treatment and continue to take the medication every day until progression of disease, prohibitive toxicity, or patient withdrawal from the study. Chemotherapy courses will repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a total of four cycles.","detailedDescription":"Patients will be monitored after every two cycles (6 weeks) for tumor response, stability, or progression by radiographic imaging studies. The primary goal of this study is to determine the clinical response rate of this regimen in patients with advanced lung cancer. Secondary endpoints include time to progression, overall survival, and toxicity. Blood levels of ERK-phosphorylation, activated caspase 3, cyclin D1, anti -cIAP2, p-Akt, and Mcl1 activity will be measured at the beginning, middle and end of therapy to help identify predictors of drug response and toxicity during the first cycle of treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Stage IIIB/IV"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sorafenib + Docetaxel/Carboplatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"400 mg po BID Sorafenib + 75 mg/m2 IV Docetaxel on day 1 plus AUC 6 on Carboplatin on day 1 of each 21 day cycle","interventionNames":["Drug: Sorafenib + Docetaxel/Carboplatin"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Sorafenib + Docetaxel/Carboplatin","description":"400 mg po BID Sorafenib + 75 mg/m2 IV Docetaxel on day 1 plus AUC 6 on Carboplatin on day 1 of each 21 day cycle","armGroupLabels":["Sorafenib + Docetaxel/Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["Carboplatin: Paraplatin, CBDCA"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Number of Patients With Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC Response Rate to the Combination Therapy of Sorafenib and Docetaxel/Carboplatin","description":"The response rate from the combination therapy of Sorafenib and Docetaxel/carboplatin for patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
