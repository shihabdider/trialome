SILC questionnaire comprises 3 individual symptoms \\& are scored at individual symptom level, thus have a dyspnea score, chest pain score, \\& cough score. There are a total of 9 questions in SILC questionnaire, each question has a minimum value of 0 \\& maximum value of 4. Each individual symptom score is calculated as average of responses for symptom items. 'Chest pain' score is mean of question 1 \\& 2, 'Cough' score is mean of question 3 \\& 4 and 'Dyspnea' score is mean of question 5 to 9 in SILC questionnaire. An increase in score is suggestive of a worsening in symptomology. A score change of ≥0.3 points for dyspnea \\& cough symptom scores is considered to be clinically significant; whereas a score change of≥0.5 points for chest pain score is considered to be clinically significant.","populationDescription":"ITT population with a non-missing baseline and at least a post-baseline PRO assessment (i.e., PRO evaluable population).","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","unitOfMeasure":"Units on a scale","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 3 and 6 months after disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (up to approximately 25 months)","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"Arm B (Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed)","description":"Participants received IV infusion of 500 mg/m\\^2 pemetrexed on Day 1 q3w, and as per investigator's choice of either IV infusion of carboplatin on Day 1 q3w with a dose calculated using 'Calvert formula' to obtain AUC =6 mg/mL/min or IV infusion of 75 mg/m\\^2 cisplatin q3w on Day 1 q3w, during induction dosing period for 4 or 6 cycles (Cycle length=21 days).
