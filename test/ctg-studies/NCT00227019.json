Patients with brain metastases have often been excluded from large randomized phase III trials due to concerns of poorer survival and impaired ability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, as survival has improved, some trials have included such patients, often finding similar benefit to patients with metastatic disease elsewhere.\n\nBevacizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, has emerged as an important adjunct to platinum-based chemotherapy doublets for use in advanced NSCLC. This drug is normally used as a first line chemotherapy. Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-folate agent,which is approved for use in first-line (with platinum), maintenance, and second-line treatment of advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Based on the efficacy of pemetrexed as a second line agent and the safety questions surrounding bevacizumab in those with treated brain metastases, a trial was designed to look at the combination of both agents as a second line therapy in NSCLC patients with treated stable brain metastases"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","Lung Cancer","Neoplasm Metastasis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":16,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"bevacizumab+ pemetrexed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"pemetrexed (500 mg/m² IV) + bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV).
