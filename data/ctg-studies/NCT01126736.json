All patients will receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) in combination with eribulin. All patients in a cohort will receive the same dose level of eribulin and there will not be any intra-patient dose escalation.\n\nThe dose level of eribulin will be escalated for additional cohorts in each of the two arms unless greater than or equal to 2 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are reported at the lower dose level(s) prior to enrollment of the next dose level.\n\nPhase II- Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either eribulin in combination with pemetrexed, in each of two dosing schedules (Arms 1 and 2), or pemetrexed alone (Arm 3). For both the Phase Ib and II portions, 1 cycle of therapy will last 21 days, with an estimated number of 6 cycles. Radiologic examinations including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as appropriate (and CT or magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\] as appropriate), will be performed during Screening and thereafter every 2 cycles until disease progression."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["neoplams","lung neoplasms","Stage IIIB","IV Nonsquamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":98,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Low Dose E7389 in Combination with Pemetrexed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: eribulin mesylate"]},{"label":"Pemetrexed","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: pemetrexed"]},{"label":"High Dose E7389 in Cominbation with Pemetrexed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Eribulin mesylate (eribulin; E7389) administered as a 2-5 minute intravenous (IV) bolus in one of two dosing schedules for both the Phase Ib and Phase 2 portions: either Days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle in ascending doses of 0.7, 1.1, or 1.4 mg/m2 or on Day 1 of the 21-day cycle at doses at ascending doses of 0.9, 1.4, or 2.0 mg/m2.","interventionNames":["Drug: Eribulin mesylate (eribulin; E7389)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"eribulin mesylate","description":"Eribulin mesylate (eribulin; E7389) administered as a 2-5 minute intravenous (IV) bolus in one of two dosing schedules for both the Phase Ib and Phase 2 portions: either Days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle in ascending doses of 0.7, 1.1, or 1.4 mg/m2 or on Day 1 of the 21-day cycle at doses at ascending doses of 0.9, 1.4, or 2.0 mg/m2.","armGroupLabels":["Low Dose E7389 in Combination with Pemetrexed"],"otherNames":["halichrondrin B analog; Alimta"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"pemetrexed","description":"Pemetrexed given at a dose of 500 mg/m2 as an IV infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
