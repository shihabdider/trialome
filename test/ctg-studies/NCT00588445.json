The study will be conducted in patients with Stage I and II NSCLC who have been determined to be operable and resectable.\n\nPatients must have 1 or more of the following features: never smoker or smoking history of \\< 15 pack years and/or features of bronchioloalveolar lung cancer. 50 patients will be enrolled on this study. Treatment will be with gefitinib for at least 21 days before surgery (depending on the timing of the surgery). Patients will discontinue gefitinib 2 days before their operation. For patients that demonstrate a radiographic response to gefitinib preoperatively and /or patients with mutations in the protein-tyrosine kinase domain of the EGF receptor gene (identified from the surgical sample), gefitinib will continue for 2 years post-surgery. Patients who do not have evidence of radiographic response or mutations in the protein-tyrosine kinase domain of the EGF receptor gene will be removed from the study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Bronchioloalveolar Cancer"],"keywords":["Lung Cancer","Non-small cell lung cancer","Gefitnib","Cancer","NSCLC","bronchioloalveolar cancer","smoker"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":65,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Gefitinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Gefitinib","description":"Patients will receive gefitinib 250 mg po daily for at least 21 days preoperatively (depending on the timing of the surgery).
