Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancer. The development of targeted therapies has changed the approach to treating NSCLC significantly over the past decade with targeted therapies generally possessing safety advantages over traditional cytotoxic regimens. However, combination paradigms and resistance patterns complicate the use of these agents. CRLX101 is a nanoparticle comprised of camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to a cyclodextrin-based polymer. CRLX101 is designed to increase the exposure of tumor cells to CPT while minimizing side effects."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":157,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"CRLX101","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: CRLX101"]},{"label":"Best supportive care","type":"OTHER","interventionNames":["Other: Best Supportive Care"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"CRLX101","description":"CRLX101 is administered at 15mg/m2 IV every other week","armGroupLabels":["CRLX101"],"otherNames":["NLG207"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Best Supportive Care","description":"best supportive care","armGroupLabels":["Best supportive care"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To Compare Overall Survival of Patients Treated With CRLX101 + BSC to Those Patients Treated With BSC Only","description":"Comparison of survival among patients treated with CRLX101 + best supportive care vs patients treated wiht best supportive care only.","timeFrame":"Up to 18 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assess Objective Response Rate (ORR) of CRLX101+ BSC Compared to BSC Only","description":"Comparison of objective response rate in subjects treated with CRLX101+BSC versus subjects treated with BSC alone.","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male or female patients who are ≥ 18-years of age.\n* Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, bronchoalveolar, squamous cell, large cell, or mixed carcinoma) that is not amendable to surgical treatment and patient has have failed 1 or 2 different lines of chemotherapy.\n* Measureable disease and evidence of progression on the previous therapy.
