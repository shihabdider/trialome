This research may help researchers in the future to learn more about the causes, risks, treatments, or prevention of cancers or other health problems.\n\nParticipants will consent to a screening period, a core or treatment phase, and a post-study observation phase. During the screening phase, participants will undergo a series of tests to determine if they are eligible for the study. The core study period, or treatment period, will start with a single dose of radiation and then continue for the first eight treatments of pembrolizumab, approximately 24-28 weeks. Participants will have a new biopsy taken after two treatments of the study drug. Following the 24-28 week treatment cycle, if the cancer is responding to treatment, the participant's physician will continue to treat with pembrolizumab as a standard treatment. Following treatment, the post-study observation phase will monitor participant response to drugs and outcomes.","detailedDescription":"The primary goal of this trial is to compare the efficacy of focal radiation (RT) to an index lesion as a way of enhancing the anti-tumor immune response to pembrolizumab to that of pembrolizumab alone. The primary efficacy endpoint is overall RECIST-defined response outside the radiation field.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the tumor responses outside the radiation field (abscopal effect) after radiation followed by pembrolizumab in metastatic NSCLC.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients with NSCLC receiving pembrolizumab, who receive Single Fraction Radiation Therapy (SFRT)\n2. To determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of SFRT and pembrolizumab\n3. To examine potential predictive biomarkers in tumor samples and peripheral blood in patients treated with pembrolizumab and SFRT\n4. To determine the local control of SFRT in the radiated lesion, when SFRT is given with pembrolizumab\n5. To evaluate the induction of a T-cell response in patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with radiation and the effect of radiation"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Lung Cancer","pembrolizumab","focal radiation","RT"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":13,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single Fraction Radiation Therapy (SFRT) + pembrolizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"200mg Pembrolizumab by IV infusion on day 1 of each 3 week cycle. 8Gy will be given in a single fraction on the first day of treatment","interventionNames":["Drug: Pembrolizumab","Radiation: Single Fraction Radiation Therapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab","description":"200mg Pembrolizumab by IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Single Fraction Radiation Therapy (SFRT) + pembrolizumab"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Single Fraction Radiation Therapy","description":"8Gy radiation therapy will be given in a single fraction on the first day of treatment","armGroupLabels":["Single Fraction Radiation Therapy (SFRT) + pembrolizumab"],"otherNames":["SFRT","RT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Patients With Each Response as Measured by RECIST 1.1","description":"The Best Overall Response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
