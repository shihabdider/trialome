Both items on the GHS/QoL scale are scored from 1 (very poor GHS/QoL) to 7 (excellent GHS/QoL) and scores for both items are averaged and a linear transformation applied to standardize the overall GHS/QoL score from 0 to 100, with higher overall scores indicating higher GHS/QoL.","populationDescription":"All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment and have at least one EORTC-QLQ-C30 Item 30 assessment data available.","reportingStatus":"POSTED","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","unitOfMeasure":"Sore on a scale","timeFrame":"Baseline (cycle 1 in neoadjuvant phase) and adjuvant week 10 (up to Study Week 30)","groups":[{"id":"OG000","title":"NAC + Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant Pembrolizumab","description":"Neoadjuvant: Prior to surgery, participants receive up to 4 cycles (cycle length: 3 weeks) of pembrolizumab \\[200 mg, intravenous (IV); given on cycle day 1\\] in combination with platinum doublet neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), consisting of cisplatin \\[75 mg/m\\^2, IV; given on cycle day 1\\] and either Gemcitabine \\[1000 mg/m\\^2, IV; given on cycle days 1 and 8\\] or Pemetrexed \\[500 mg/m\\^2, IV; given on cycle day 1\\].\n\nAdjuvant: 4-12 weeks following surgery, participants receive 13 cycles (cycle length: 3 weeks) of pembrolizumab \\[200 mg, IV; given on cycle day 1\\]."},{"id":"OG001","title":"NAC + Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant Placebo","description":"Neoadjuvant: Prior to surgery, participants receive up to 4 cycles (cycle length: 3 weeks) of placebo \\[normal saline, IV; given on cycle day 1\\] in combination with platinum doublet NAC, consisting of cisplatin \\[75 mg/m\\^2, IV; given on cycle day 1\\] and either Gemcitabine \\[1000 mg/m\\^2, IV; given on cycle days 1 and 8\\] or Pemetrexed \\[500 mg/m\\^2, IV; given on cycle day 1\\].\n\nAdjuvant: 4-12 weeks following surgery, participants receive 13 cycles (cycle length: 3 weeks) of placebo \\[normal saline, IV; given on cycle day 1\\]."}],"denoms":[{"units":"Participants","counts":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"395"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"397"}]}],"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.52","lowerLimit":"-3.67","upperLimit":"0.63"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.74","lowerLimit":"-5.96","upperLimit":"-1.52"}]}]}],"analyses":[{"groupIds":["OG000","OG001"],"nonInferiorityType":"OTHER","nonInferiorityComment":"Based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model with the scores as the response variable with covariates for treatment by visit interaction and stratification factors (Stage (II versus III), TPS (\\>=50% versus \\<50%), Histology (Squamous versus Non-squamous) and Region (East-Asia versus non-East Asia).","pValue":"0.1197","statisticalMethod":"t-test, 2 sided","paramType":"Difference in Least Square Means","paramValue":"2.22","ciPctValue":"95","ciNumSides":"TWO_SIDED","ciLowerLimit":"-0.58","ciUpperLimit":"5.02"}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE)","reportingStatus":"NOT_POSTED","anticipatedPostingDate":"2027-06","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 71 weeks","denomUnitsSelected":"Participants"},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Experience Perioperative Complications","description":"Perioperative complications are a discrete set of both intraoperative and postoperative complications, potentially contributing to increased length of inpatient care and/or delay of adjuvant therapy.
