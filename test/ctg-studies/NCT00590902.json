The first study of OSI-774 was done to evaluate what dose should be given to patients with cancer has been completed. The purpose of this research study is to see whether this experimental treatment, called OSI-774, can cause a type of non-small cell lung cancer to stop growing or shrink. This study is sponsored by a company called Genentech, and is being done at Memorial Hospital, as well as other cancer centers around the country interested in developing new drugs for the treatment of this type of cancer."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Bronchioloalveolar Cell Variant of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["non small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":81,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1 - OSI-774","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: OSI-774: erlotinib, TarcevaTM"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"OSI-774: erlotinib, TarcevaTM","description":"150 mg, 100 mg and 25 mg tablets","armGroupLabels":["1 - OSI-774"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Objective Response of OSI-774","description":"(complete and partial responses) Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee.
