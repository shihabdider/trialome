Advances in radiation oncology have allowed better radiation targeting which may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving more precise and targeted radiation before standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells and prevent the cancer from coming back in the location in which it started.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the primary tumor control rate at 12 months.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To further establish safety and tolerability of this regimen. II. To estimate the rates of regional, distant control as well as progression-free survival and overall survival.\n\nIII. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) to this regimen. IV. To evaluate the response of tumors to stereotactic (high-dose) radiation using magnetic resonance tumor perfusion imaging modalities (magnetic resonance \\[MR\\]-dynamic contrast-enhanced \\[DCE\\]/perfusion weighted imaging \\[PWI\\], MR-diffusion, blood oxygenation level dependent \\[BOLD\\] sequences).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients will receive a hypofractionated boost to the primary tumor over 2 fractions (at least 40 hours apart) during week 1. Beginning week 2, patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) on days 8, 15, 36, and 43; and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 8-12 and 36-40. If carboplatin and paclitaxel is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, 2 cycles of carboplatin (AUC=6 mg/min/mL IV on day 1, 22) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 IV on day 1, 22) consolidation chemotherapy are required, to be administered starting 4-6 weeks after concurrent chemoradiation has ended. Each cycle is 21 days long. If cisplatin and etoposide is administered concurrently with radiotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy is not allowed. Patients also undergo standard conformal radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week for a total of 30 fractions. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-small cell","Lung Cancer","Chemoradiation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":21,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (hypofractionated radiation boost, chemoradiation)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation boost over 2 fractions (at least 40 hours apart) during week 1.
