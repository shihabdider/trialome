Afatinib dimaleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not yet known whether afatinib dimaleate is more effective when given alone or with cetuximab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the phase III component by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) between patients randomized to afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) in combination with cetuximab versus afatinib alone in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase II) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination of afatinib and cetuximab compared to afatinib alone as measured by overall survival (OS) in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC. (Phase III)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) in the subset of patients with measurable disease treated with afatinib plus cetuximab compared to afatinib alone.\n\nII. To assess the safety of each treatment arm when used in the first-line setting.\n\nIII. To compare time to treatment failure and time to treatment discontinuation between randomized to afatinib in combination with cetuximab versus afatinib alone.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that confer benefit from afatinib and afatinib plus cetuximab by evaluating whether the presence of de novo EGFR T790M mutation or other molecular alterations in the pre-treatment tumor influence the clinical outcomes.\n\nII. To quantitatively assess whether the ratio of sensitizing EGFR (EGFRs) mutation to EGFR T790M influences outcome and is altered during treatment.\n\nIII. To evaluate the frequency of known mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-directed therapies in the context of afatinib plus cetuximab and afatinib alone treatment.\n\nIV. To identify potential novel predictors of benefit to afatinib plus cetuximab.\n\nV. To identify potential new mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-directed therapies.\n\nVI. To establish patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from a subset of patients by re-biopsy at the time of progressive disease for drug testing and genomic analysis.\n\nVII. To assess whether circulating tumor markers can be used as indicators of sensitivity and resistance to afatinib plus cetuximab and afatinib alone.\n\nVIII. To determine whether the levels of EGFR protein by immunohistochemistry predict for benefit to afatinib plus cetuximab and afatinib alone.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive afatinib dimaleate as in Arm I.
