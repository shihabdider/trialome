Patients will be randomized to either pemetrexed alone, pemetrexed and bevacizumab, or pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in a 1:1:1 fashion. All 3 regimens should be tolerable in poor performance status patients with advanced NSCLC. The 3-drug regimen (pemetrexed/carboplatin/bevacizumab) has been modified by lowering the dose of carboplatin, in order to minimize myelosuppression. This trial will be conducted at multiple study sites."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non small cell lung cancer","NSCLC","Pemetrexed","Bevacizumab","Avastin","Carboplatin","Stage IIIB/IV"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":172,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pemetrexed/Bevacizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV given over 10 minutes every 21 days\n* Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 21 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Bevacizumab"]},{"label":"Pemetrexed/Bevacizumab/Carboplatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"* Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV given over 10 minutes every 21 days\n* Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 21 days\n* Carboplatin AUC=5 IV every 21 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed","Drug: Bevacizumab","Drug: Carboplatin"]},{"label":"Pemetrexed","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV given over 10 minutes every 21 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Pemetrexed"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pemetrexed","description":"500 mg/m2 IV given over 10 minutes every 21 days","armGroupLabels":["Pemetrexed","Pemetrexed/Bevacizumab","Pemetrexed/Bevacizumab/Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["Alimta"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Bevacizumab","description":"15 mg/kg IV every 21 days","armGroupLabels":["Pemetrexed/Bevacizumab","Pemetrexed/Bevacizumab/Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["Avastin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Carboplatin","description":"AUC=5 IV every 21 days","armGroupLabels":["Pemetrexed/Bevacizumab/Carboplatin"],"otherNames":["Paraplatin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","description":"The Length of Time, in Months, That Patients Were Alive From Their First Date of Protocol Treatment Until Worsening of Their Disease.
