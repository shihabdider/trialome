Part 1 considered escalating doublet (NKTR 214 + nivolumab) doses to determine the RP2D. Part 2 considered dose expansion cohorts for the doublet (NKTR 214 + nivolumab ± chemotherapy). Part 3 was schedule-finding for a triplet therapy (NKTR 214 + nivolumab + ipilimumab). Part 4 dose expansion for the triplet (NKTR 214 + nivolumab + ipilimumab) was planned to further assess the efficacy of the RP2D triplet combination at dosing schedules from Part 3.","detailedDescription":"Part 1 enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NKTR 214 + nivolumab doublet therapy.\n\nPart 2 enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies (including 9 tumor types consisting of the same 5 tumor types as in Part 1, plus hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \\[HER 2\\] negative breast cancer \\[HR+ HER2- BC\\], gastric cancer, colorectal carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer \\[SCLC\\]) to assess the efficacy of the RP2D.\n\nPart 3 enrolled patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, or urothelial carcinoma (UCC) in a first-line setting (1L) to assess the safety and tolerability of NKTR 214 + nivolumab + ipilimumab triplet therapy Three dosing schedules were evaluated to establish RP2D dosing schedules for Part 4 of the study.\n\nPart 4 planned to enroll patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, or UCC to further assess the efficacy of the RP2D triplet combination at the 3 dosing schedules from Part 3. Patients were enrolled simultaneously to each tumor cohort.\n\nAll patients enrolled in the study were closely monitored for safety, tolerability and response per RECIST criteria.
