Recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung or head and neck squamous cell cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the response rate of the combination of pembrolizumab and recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein (sEphB4-HSA) as combination therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the biomarkers of response. II. Determine the unique toxicities of the combination of pembrolizumab and sEphB4-HSA.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
