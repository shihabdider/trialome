Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. In intensity-modulated radiotherapy, multiple beam angles and dozens of beam segments are used to deliver highly conformal radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving PET-adjusted IMRT together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the efficacy (based on post-treatment PET findings) of dose-painted intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent chemotherapy for locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the efficacy (based on clinical endpoints including locoregional control \\[LRC\\], disease-free survival \\[DFS\\], and overall survival \\[OS\\]) of dose-painted IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy for LA-NSCLC.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety of dose-painted IMRT with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy for LA-NSCLC.\n\nIII. To evaluate the utility of post-treatment PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging as a predictor of clinical outcomes following treatment with this novel approach.\n\nIV. To explore, in a preliminary manner, whether metabolomic markers in the blood and urine prior to and during the course of treatment are associated with treatment response, clinical endpoints, and treatment-related adverse events such as radiation pneumonitis.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nRADIATION THERAPY: Patients undergo PET-adjusted IMRT or proton beam radiation therapy five days a week for 5 weeks.\n\nCONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 5 weeks beginning week 1 of thoracic radiotherapy.\n\nCONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning approximately 4-6 weeks after the completion of all radiation therapy and when esophagitis and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy are grade 1 or less, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1500, and platelet count \\> 100,000, patients may receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
