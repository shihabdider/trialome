Determine efficacy (objective response rate (ORR)) of front-line pembrolizumab for metastatic EGFR mutation positive programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)+ (\\> 1% by immunohistochemistry \\[IHC\\]) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine safety (adverse event tabulation and grading) of front-line pembrolizumab for metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (\\> 1% by IHC) NSCLC.\n\nII. Determine efficacy (progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)) of front-line pembrolizumab for metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (\\>1% by IHC) NSCLC.\n\nIII. Determine ORR, PFS and OS of subsequent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutation after pembrolizumab.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Analyze tumor tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
