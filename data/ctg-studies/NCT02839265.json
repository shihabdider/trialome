All patients will receive daily subcutaneous injections of CDX-301 (75 µg/kg) for 5 days, beginning on the first day of SBRT. SBRT will be delivered to a single pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesion. The SBRT regimen will depend on the size and location of the target lesion. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival at 4 months, defined using immune-related response criteria (irRC).","detailedDescription":"Primary Objective\n\n* To explore the efficacy of combining stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with FLT3 ligand immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* To establish the feasibility and safety of combining SBRT with FLT3 ligand immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC.\n* To quantify and evaluate potential surrogate outcomes for clinical efficacy of this treatment approach, including radiographic responses, immunologic responses, and circulating tumor cell levels."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":33,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SBRT + FLT3 Ligand Immunotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will be treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to a single pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesion as well as FLT3 immunotherapy.\n\nFLT3 Ligand Therapy (CDX-301)\n\n* Daily subcutaneous injections of CDX-301 (75 ug/kg) will be administered for 5 days, beginning on the first day of SBRT.\n* Additional cycles of SBRT (to distinct lesions) and CDX-301 may be administered every 2-4 months to subjects who demonstrate evidence of clinical benefit (lack of treatment-related toxicity and no disease progression).\n* Study therapy will be discontinued in cases of treatment-related toxicity or disease progression.","interventionNames":["Drug: FLT3 Ligand Therapy (CDX-301)","Radiation: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"FLT3 Ligand Therapy (CDX-301)","description":"See Arm 1 descriptions","armGroupLabels":["SBRT + FLT3 Ligand Immunotherapy"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)","description":"See Arm 1 descriptions","armGroupLabels":["SBRT + FLT3 Ligand Immunotherapy"],"otherNames":["Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival","description":"The primary endpoint is progression-free survival rate at four months (PFS4), defined as the rate estimate of the percentage of patients who are alive and progression-free at 16 weeks (\\~4 months) after initiation of study therapy.","timeFrame":"4 Months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)","description":"The number of participants with evidence of DLTs will be tabulated.
