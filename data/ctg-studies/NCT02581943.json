Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may improve immune responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the immune effects of single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n\nII. Estimate the treatment response to single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the toxicity and tolerability of pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with low-dose carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n\nII. Assess quality of life (QOL) in patients receiving single agent pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n\nIII. Assess the association between immune response and clinical response.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.\n\nARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 7 and 14.\n\nIn both arms, courses repeat every 3 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days and then every 8 weeks thereafter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":43,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm I (pembrolizumab)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
