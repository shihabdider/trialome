appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL and functional scales were linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). Symptom scales/items were also linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where higher scores indicate worse symptoms (e.g., more severe/worsened) and lower scores indicate less symptoms (e.g., less severe/improvement).","populationDescription":"The PP-ITT analysis set.
