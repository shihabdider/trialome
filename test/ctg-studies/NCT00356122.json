This study provided a new combination of chemotherapy drugs - docetaxel and oxaliplatin - as first line therapy in the treatment of lung cancer. The therapy included bevacizumab that may prevent or slow down the blood supply to the tumor and may also prevent tumor growth. The three investigational drugs are United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.","detailedDescription":"The planned treatment duration for each participant is six 21-day treatment cycles of combination therapy; non-progressing participants will continue on bevacizumab monotherapy until progression. After discontinuation or after completion of all study treatments, all participants will be contacted every 3 months for a maximum of 2 years from first treatment to document overall survival and record new anticancer treatment (chemotherapy or biologic)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Lung","non-small cell","chemotherapy","tumor","advanced","recurrent","metastatic","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":53,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Docetaxel/Oxaliplatin/Bevacizumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), treated with the combination of docetaxel, followed by oxaliplatin, and then bevacizumab for Cycles 1-6 (every 3 weeks), and followed with maintenance therapy with bevacizumab every 3 weeks for a total of 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Docetaxel","Drug: Oxaliplatin","Drug: Bevacizumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Docetaxel","description":"70 mg/m\\^2 administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 for Cycles 1-6 (the treatment cycle is 3 weeks)","armGroupLabels":["Docetaxel/Oxaliplatin/Bevacizumab"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Oxaliplatin","description":"100 mg/m\\^2 administered IV on Day 1 for Cycles 1-6","armGroupLabels":["Docetaxel/Oxaliplatin/Bevacizumab"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Bevacizumab","description":"15 mg/kg administered IV on Day 1 for Cycles 1-6, and every 3 weeks during maintenance therapy for a total treatment of one year, until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.","armGroupLabels":["Docetaxel/Oxaliplatin/Bevacizumab"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS)","description":"PFS was defined as the interval from the date of registration to the earliest date of documented evidence of progressive disease, or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.\n\nProgressive disease occurred when the participant had at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, compared to the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.","timeFrame":"Baseline to PFS (up to 24 months after the first treatment)"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective Response Rate","description":"Objective response rate is the percentage of participants with an objective response.
