The safety of this combination will also be studied.","detailedDescription":"Avastin® is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF plays an important role in the growth of both normal and abnormal blood vessels. Avastin® is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the effects of VEGF.\n\nDocetaxel and carboplatin are standard chemotherapy drugs that have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of NSCLC. Docetaxel and carboplatin are designed to work by stopping the division of cancer cells.\n\nIf you are found to be eligible, you will begin receiving Avastin®, docetaxel, and carboplatin. Avastin®, carboplatin, and docetaxel will be given by vein once every 3 weeks. The first dose of Avastin® will be given over 90 minutes. The second dose of Avastin® will be given over 60 minutes. All other doses of Avastin® will be given over 30 minutes. Carboplatin and docetaxel will always be given over 30 minutes. They will be given on the same day every 3 weeks (1 cycle). You may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. You will receive standard premedication with dexamethasone to help decrease the risk of side effects. Dexamethasone will be taken before you receive your docetaxel infusion.\n\nDuring the study, you will have blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) every 3 weeks to look at your blood counts. These samples will be used only for routine lab tests. You will be seen by a physician every 3 weeks and given a physical exam. Your blood pressure will be monitored, and you will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing. A performance status evaluation will also be done. In addition, you will have a urine test every 2 cycles of treatment.\n\nAfter 2 cycles of treatment (6 weeks), you will have a chest x-ray and computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to evaluate the status of the disease. These will be repeated every 2 cycles. Your continued participation in this study depends on how your cancer responds to the study drugs. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if you experience significant side effects or your medical condition worsens. You may continue receiving bevacizumab for as long as your cancer responds to study treatment.\n\nYou will be followed-up on by phone or at routine clinic visits for at least 12 months to monitor your condition and disease status.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Avastin® has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Docetaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved and commercially available. The use of these drugs together in this study is experimental. A total of 50 patients will take part in this study. All participants will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Lung Cancer","Bevacizumab","Carboplatin","Docetaxel","Avastin","NSCLC","Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody","rhuMAb-VEGF","Paraplatin®","Taxotere"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":43,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Avastin + Docetaxel + Carboplatin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Avastin 15 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks.
