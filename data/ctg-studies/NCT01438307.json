The majority of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The majority of NSCLC cases are advanced at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy has improved overall survival but remains limited at \\< 12 months median overall survival. New approaches are needed for second line chemotherapy treatment. Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 has shown increased overall survival in metastatic prostate cancer and it is hopeful it can do the same in advanced NSCLC.","detailedDescription":"A substantial number of patients with lung cancer progress after first line treatment and require second line chemotherapy. Lung cancer appears to account for 40-50% of all known brain metastasis. The incidence of brain metastases among lung cancer patients ranges from 16-20%. Chemotherapy has had limited utility due to problems crossing the blood brain barrier.\n\nCurrently there are three drugs approved by the FDA for second line treatment of NSCLC but each has distinct toxicities. Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 is a potent novel taxane with enhanced activity against an increased number of cell lines including lung, prostate, colon, pancreas, head and neck, kidney, gastric, glioblastoma, and melanoma. It also has the ability to cross the blood brain barrier. Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 was found to have an improved antiproliferative activity than other chemotherapy agents against insensitive cell lines. The Phase I studies of Cabazitaxel-SRP6258 have determined dosage and schedule recommendations in advanced NSCLC patients to be utilized for a Phase II multicenter study.\n\nSubjects will be placed on one of two schedules (A or B) each with a specified dosage and administration schedule. All subjects will be followed for survival/progression after every 2 cycles of therapy with imaging studies. A two stage design will be used for each of the two schedules. Fourteen subjects will be accrued for each schedule in the first stage with possible accrual of an additional 34 subjects per schedule depending upon the first stage results."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","Stage IV NSCLC","Metastatic NSCLC"],"keywords":["Non-small cell lung cancer","Cabazitaxel-XRP6258","P-glycoprotein","taxane","Advanced NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":28,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Schedule A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have been previously treated will be given a specific regimen of the novel taxane, Cabazitaxel-XRP6258.\n\nSubjects with asymptomatic brain metastases will be eligible for the study and a subset analysis will take place to help determine what, if any, effect Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 has on brain metastases.","interventionNames":["Drug: Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 (3-week cycle)"]},{"label":"Schedule B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have been previously treated will be given a specific regimen of the novel taxane, Cabazitaxel-XRP6258, different from Schedule A.\n\nSubjects with asymptomatic brain metastases will be eligible for the study and a subset analysis will take place to help determine what, if any, effect Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 has on brain metastases.","interventionNames":["Drug: Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 (5-week cycle)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cabazitaxel-XRP6258 (3-week cycle)","description":"Subjects in Schedule A will begin with an initial dose of 20 mg/m2 every 3 weeks as a 1 hour IV infusion.
