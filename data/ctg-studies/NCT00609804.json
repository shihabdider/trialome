Evidence of progressive disease on erlotinib as assessed by the treating physician. Erlotinib must be the last treatment for NSCLC prior to enrollment into this study. Patients may be on erlotinib until enrollment. If erlotinib has already been stopped, the period of time off Erlotinib cannot exceed 14 days prior to study enrollment.\n4.
