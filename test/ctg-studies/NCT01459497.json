Poor performance status patients can be a heterogeneous group, with tumor-related factors, other co-morbidities, or advanced age placing patients in the category. These patients have traditionally been underrepresented in clinical trials, and thus no prospective study has evaluated the efficacy of other radiotherapy dose fractionations in these patients. One phase III trial of \"poor-risk\" locally advanced NSCLC (RTOG 93-04) included just over 40% Karnofsky performance status 60-70 patients and showed median survival times of 9.5 and 10.3 months with 60Gy of conventional radiation therapy alone or with recombinant β-interferon \\[18\\]. 1 year overall survival was just 44% in these patients.\n\nThis study includes randomization to two arms. Arm A (experimental arm) will include IGRT, 60 Gy in 15 fractions (3 weeks). Arm B will include conventional radiation, 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions (6 weeks) with optional concurrent with carboplatin/taxol .\n\nThe experimental arm dose for this trial is based on a dose escalation trial at University of Texas Southwestern evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of hypofractionated IGRT in this patient population (Phase I study IRB #072010-050). Doses were escalated from 3 Gy per fraction (total dose 45 Gy) to 4 Gy per fraction (total dose 60 Gy) and evaluation for treatment related toxicity was being performed. Critical structure dose constraints will be expressed as organ dose-volume limits, with limits formulated with the approval of the study investigators using known tolerance data, radiobiological conversion models, and norms used in current practice at academic centers \\[27\\].\n\nRandomization Schema:\n\nPatients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block within strata to balance for patient factors other than institution. The stratifying variables are Zubrod performance status (2 vs. \\> 2) and stage (II vs. III)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["non-small cell lung cancer","Stages II or III non-small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":103,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Radiation Therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Arm A:Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT), 60 Gy in 15 fractions in 3 weeks","interventionNames":["Radiation: Radiation Therapy"]},{"label":"Conventional Radiation","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Arm B: Conventional radiation 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions in 6-7 weeks","interventionNames":["Radiation: Conventional radiation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Radiation Therapy","description":"Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT)60 Gy in 15 fractions in 3 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Radiation Therapy"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Conventional radiation","description":"Conventional radiation 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions in 6-7 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Conventional Radiation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Survival of Standard Radiation (CFRT) Versus Accelerated, Hypofractionated, Image-guided Conformal Radiotherapy (IGRT) in Treatment of Stage II-III NSCLC in Patients With Poor Performance Status at 1 Year.","description":"Percentage of participants with overall survival at 1 year.
