Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving imatinib mesylate together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the clinical efficacy of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and intermittent imatinib in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and intermittent imatinib in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nII. To collect paraffin tissue blocks for a companion project evaluating the expression of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) by original tumor specimens, and its relationship to response rate and survival.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 3, 10, and 17 and imatinib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Malignant Pleural Effusion","Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":34,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (enzyme inhibitor, chemotherapy)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 3, 10, and 17 and imatinib mesylate PO QD on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18.
