In Phase II, the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy administered in 21-day treatment cycles at a dose selected in Phase I.\n\nTumor types in the study will include: cervical, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, esophageal, gastric adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck cancers- squamous cell, hepatocellular, prostate, non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic, renal cell, small-cell lung cancer, non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC).","detailedDescription":"The outcome measures are planned to be assessed up to the data cutoff date.
