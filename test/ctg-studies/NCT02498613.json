Cediranib maleate and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cediranib maleate may also block the flow of oxygen to the tumor, and may help make the tumor more sensitive to olaparib.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of cediranib (cediranib maleate) plus olaparib in combination in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of the following tumor types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of oral administration of cediranib in combination with olaparib in patients with select advanced solid tumors.\n\nII. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) in each tumor cohort.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the prevalence of the mutations of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes in tumors using the BROCA panel and to correlate tumor regression with mutations status. (Integrated) II. To evaluate changes in tumor hypoxia on cediranib treatment compared to baseline by \\[F-18\\] fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with NSCLC.\n\nIII. To evaluate levels of angiogenesis/inflammatory markers including VEGF at baseline and on treatment.\n\nIV. To evaluate levels of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at baseline and on treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1. Patients undergoing FMISO scan also receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) beginning the day after the second FMISO scan and the rest of the patients receive olaparib PO BID beginning day 4 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days (35 days for cycle 1) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks. Patients who discontinue the study treatment for reasons other than disease progression or withdrawal of consent will continue to be followed every 4 weeks until disease progression, start of new therapy, or death, whichever occurs first."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Advanced Malignant Solid Neoplasm","Metastatic Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Lung Small Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma","Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma","Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma","Stage III Breast Cancer AJCC v7","Stage III Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7","Stage III Lung Small Cell Carcinoma AJCC v7","Stage III Pancreatic Cancer AJCC v6 and v7","Stage IIIA Breast Cancer AJCC v7","Stage IIIA Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7","Stage IIIA Lung Small Cell Carcinoma AJCC v7","Stage IIIB Breast Cancer AJCC v7","Stage IIIB Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7","Stage IIIB Lung Small Cell Carcinoma AJCC v7","Stage IIIC Breast Cancer AJCC v7","Stage IV Breast Cancer AJCC v6 and v7","Stage IV Lung Non-Small Cell Cancer AJCC v7","Stage IV Lung Small Cell Carcinoma AJCC v7","Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer AJCC v6 and v7","Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma","Unresectable Lung Small Cell Carcinoma","Unresectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma","Unresectable Pancreatic Carcinoma","Unresectable Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":122,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (cediranib maleate, olaparib)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive cediranib maleate PO QD on day 1.

peripheral blood smear or bone marrow biopsy, if clinically indicated\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib and cediranib have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; due to the fact that there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with olaparib and cediranib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cediranib and olaparib\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential
