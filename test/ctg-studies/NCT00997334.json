To measure the steady-state plasma concentrations of erlotinib during the course of patients' treatment.\n\n   * Determine if the development and/or resolution of skin toxicity is related to plasma erlotinib concentrations.\n   * Determine if the development of disease progression while on erlotinib is correlated with declines in plasma erlotinib concentrations.\n   * Assess the plasma levels in patients whose smoking status has been biochemically verified to determine if smoking is associated with lower erlotinib plasma concentration.\n2. To analyze from both free plasma DNA and DNA from circulating tumor cells of erlotinib-treated patients for the original sensitizing EGFR mutations and genetic changes associated with secondary resistance.\n3. To measure clinical outcomes in patients with known sensitizing mutations in their tumor EGFR when treated with first-line erlotinib.\n\n   * Response rate\n   * Time to progression\n   * Median overall survival"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["erlotinib","EGFR mutation","NSCLC"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Erlotinib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Erlotinib was given at a dose of 150mg orally once per day for 28 days (+/- 3 days); Patients are treated until disease progression or until unaccepted drug toxicity.","interventionNames":["Drug: Erlotinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Erlotinib","armGroupLabels":["Erlotinib"],"otherNames":["Tarceva"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Resistance Mechanism","description":"Participants were classified into 4 potential resistant mechanism groups (4 genetic/ 1 histologic) based on evaluation of rebiopsy tissue: EGFR mutations (T790M mutation, exon 20 insertion), KRAS mutations, MET amplification or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transform using established methods.","timeFrame":"Participants were evaluated for incidence of genetic mechanisms of secondary resistance at time of disease progression at which point participants stopped treatment.
