Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Diagnostic imaging procedures, such as FDG-labeled PET scan, may help in guiding chemotherapy and allow doctors to plan better treatment","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the response rate in patients who do not demonstrate an early response to carboplatin/paclitaxel as determined by FDG-PET (\"initial non-responders\") who are subsequently treated with three additional courses of docetaxel/gemcitabine.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the ability of FDG-PET to predict response to therapy as measured by computed tomography (CT).\n\nII. Evaluate the early and late changes in tumor FDG uptake (change in standardized uptake value \\[SUV\\]) in all patients and correlate with overall survival (OS).\n\nOUTLINE: All patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT scan between days 18-21.\n\nPatients are then assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.\n\nGROUP I (Responders): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nGROUP II (Initial non-responders): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT scan between days 18-21 of course 2.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 81-84 and then periodically thereafter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Malignant Pleural Effusion","Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Chemotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
