Patients will receive pembrolizumab for 2 cycles prior to surgery or SRT and surgery. Surgical resection of all involved areas of tumor will occur within 6 weeks of the last administration of pembrolizumab. It should be noted that surgery is expected to occur within a much shorter window and 6 weeks would represent the greatest allowable amount of delay.\n\nIf during the run-in, only the pembrolizumab-alone cohort meets pre-specified safety parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter a larger expansion cohort, with treatment given according to that cohort only. If during the run-in both cohorts meet pre-specified safety parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter the expansion cohort and be randomized between preoperative pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab with SRT of 12 Gy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["non small cell lung cancer, resectable"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":12,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pembrolizumab + Surgery","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will receive 200mg pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each 3 week cycle, for 2 cycles, prior to surgery.
