In addition, the response rate to each regimen, response duration, time to progression and time to treatment failure will be measured. Toxicity will be evaluated and compared between the two groups.","detailedDescription":"This is a randomized, multicenter, Phase III open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® in combination with every three (3) week carboplatin compared to paclitaxel plus carboplatin every three (3) weeks, in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received cytotoxic agents for advanced disease. Patients may have been previously treated with immunological agents. Patients will be randomized to receive Taxoprexin® at a dose of 400 mg/m2 intravenously by one (1)-hour weekly infusion, 5/6 weeks followed immediately by carboplatin AUC = 4 on weeks one (1) and four (4) as a 30 minute intravenous infusion or paclitaxel 225mg/m2 as a three (3) hour intravenous infusion followed immediately by carboplatin AUC = 6 as a 30 minute intravenous infusion, every three (3) weeks.
