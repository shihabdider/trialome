To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplified squamous cell lung cancer patients treated with BIBF 1120 (nintedanib).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for the entire FGFR1 amplified group versus the FGFR1 non-amplified patients.\n\nII. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for each FGFR1 amplified group (low, intermediate, and high) versus historical controls and FGFR1 non-amplified patients.\n\nIII. To assess the following endpoints overall and by FGFR1 group: PFS, overall survival (OS), confirmed tumor response rate, and adverse events.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. The relation of FGFR1 gene copy number with PFS, OS, confirmed response rate, and adverse events.\n\nII. The relationship fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) polymorphisms with toxicity and efficacy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
