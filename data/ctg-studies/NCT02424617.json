After 6 participants have been dosed and safety established; Arm A (dose escalation arm) was opened to confirm the bemcentinib dose to be used in combination with erlotinib.\n\nIn Arm A the dose of bemcentinib (BGB324) was escalated in a standard 3+3 fashion until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination (bemcentinib + erlotinib) was established.
