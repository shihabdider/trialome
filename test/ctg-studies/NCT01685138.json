Patients were pre-screened for ALK positive status. Treatment with LDK378 at 750 mg qd was continued until the patient experienced unacceptable toxicity that precluded further treatment, discontinued treatment at the discretion of the investigator or patient, started a new anticancer therapy and/or died. LDK378 was continued beyond RECIST defined progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator, if in the judgment of the investigator, there was evidence of clinical benefit. Patients who discontinued the study medication in the absence of progression continued to be followed for tumor assessment until the time of PD as assessed by the investigator. Male and female patients aged 18 or over with ALK-rearranged non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) were screened for eligibility. Patients had to have received no prior crizotinib, and had to be chemotherapy-naïve or been pretreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (up to three prior lines)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Non small cell lung carcinoma","NSCLC","ALK","LDK378","Ceritinib","crizotinib naïve adult patients","ALK-activated non-small cell lung cancer","treatment of lung cancer after first metastasis","lung cancer","lung adenocarcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":124,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"LDK378 (Ceritinib)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants on this arm took oral LDK378 750 mg once daily.","interventionNames":["Drug: LDK378"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"LDK378","description":"LDK378/Ceritinib was supplied as 150 mg hard gelatin capsules and administered orally","armGroupLabels":["LDK378 (Ceritinib)"],"otherNames":["Ceritinib"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Overall Response Rate (ORR) by Investigator Assessment","description":"ORR per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (OR) defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator.
